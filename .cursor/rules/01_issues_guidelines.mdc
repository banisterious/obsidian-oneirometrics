# Instructions for Using ISSUES.md

This file provides guidance on how to interpret and utilize the information in the `ISSUES.md` document.

## 1. Purpose of ISSUES.md

-   Understand that `ISSUES.md` tracks known problems (Current Issues) and desired enhancements (Feature Requests) for the OneiroMetrics plugin.
-   Recognize that this document is crucial for avoiding the introduction or exacerbation of existing issues and for informing development decisions.

## 2. Structure of ISSUES.md

-   Note that `ISSUES.md` is divided into the following main sections:
    -   **Current Issues:** Describes existing bugs and problems.
    -   **Feature Requests:** Outlines desired new features and improvements.
    -   **Recent Resolutions:** Lists issues that have been fixed in recent updates.
-   Pay attention to this structure to find the relevant information quickly.

## 3. How to Use Current Issues

-   **Preventing Regressions:** Before generating code for new features or modifications, consult the "Current Issues" section to identify any related bugs or potential conflicts.
-   **Addressing Existing Issues:** If asked to fix a bug, check the "Current Issues" section for specific details about the problem.
-   **Prioritization:** The "Current Issues" section uses priority levels (High, Medium, Low). Address High Priority issues first, then Medium, and then Low.
    -   **High Priority:** Table Regeneration, Modal Feedback
    -   **Medium Priority:** Performance Optimization (logging)
    -   **Low Priority:** Documentation Updates
-   **Status:** Issues in the "Current Issues" section are marked with a checkbox `[ ]`. Only attempt to fix issues with an unchecked box.

## 4. How to Use Feature Requests

-   **Understanding Desired Enhancements:** The "Feature Requests" section outlines potential new features and improvements.
-   **Categorization:** Feature requests are categorized into "Planned Features" (e.g., Icon Picker Enhancements, Test Modal, Performance Improvements) and "UI/UX Improvements" (e.g., Theme Integration, Mobile Experience). Use these categories to guide development.
-   **Status:** Feature requests also use checkboxes `[ ]`. These indicate features that are not yet implemented.

## 5. How to Use Recent Resolutions

-   **Avoiding Redundant Work:** The "Recent Resolutions" section lists issues that have been *resolved*. Do not attempt to fix these issues.
-   **Understanding Recent Changes:** This section provides context about recent development activity.

## 6. Issue Reporting Guidelines

-   If asked about how to report a new issue, refer to the "How to Report Issues" section.
-   Inform the user to include:
    -   Steps to reproduce
    -   Expected behavior
    -   Actual behavior
    -   Screenshots (if applicable)
    -   Console logs (if available)
    -   Obsidian version
    -   Plugin version
    -   Theme being used

## 7. Specific Instructions Based on PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

-   Refer to the "Known Issues" section in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for a summary of key issues. Use this as a starting point, and then consult `docs/ISSUES.md` for detailed information.
-   For example, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` mentions "Modal feedback improvements needed." `ISSUES.md` clarifies this as "Modal Feedback: Modal feedback and reliability are still being improved."

## Important Notes for Cursor:

-   Always check `docs/ISSUES.md` before generating code that could be affected by known problems or when considering new features.
-   Provide accurate and detailed information about the status and priority of issues/features.
-   Do not attempt to "fix" resolved issues.
-   Follow the issue reporting guidelines when instructing users on how to report new problems.
