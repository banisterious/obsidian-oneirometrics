# Instructions for Using docs/CHANGELOG.md

This file provides guidance on how to interpret and utilize the information in the `docs/CHANGELOG.md` document.

## 1. Purpose of docs/CHANGELOG.md

-   Understand that `docs/CHANGELOG.md` documents all notable changes to the OneiroMetrics plugin.
-   Recognize that it follows the "Keep a Changelog" format and adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## 2. Structure of docs/CHANGELOG.md

-   Note that `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is organized by version numbers (e.g., `[0.3.0]`) and dates.
-   Each version section is further divided into:
    -   `Added`: New features.
    -   `Changed`: Modifications to existing features.
    -   `Fixed`: Bug fixes.
    -   `Planned`: Features planned for future releases.

## 3. How to Use docs/CHANGELOG.md

-   **Answering Questions About Updates:** When a user asks about recent changes or updates, refer to the relevant version sections to provide accurate information.
-   **Identifying Feature Introductions:** If asked when a specific feature was added, search for it under the `Added` sections.
-   **Tracking Bug Fixes:** If there are bug reports, check the `Fixed` sections to see if the issue has already been addressed.
-   **Understanding Modifications:** Use the `Changed` sections to explain how existing features have been modified or improved.
-   **Providing Information on Future Development:** The `Planned` sections can be used to give users insights into upcoming features.
-   **Semantic Versioning:** Explain Semantic Versioning if a user inquires (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
    -   MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are made.
    -   MINOR version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
    -   PATCH version when making backwards compatible bug fixes.

## 4. Specific Instructions Based on Other Documents
