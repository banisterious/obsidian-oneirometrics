# Instructions for Understanding docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

This file provides guidance on how to interpret the `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` document. Please read this *before* processing any other instructions.

## 1. Project Context and Purpose

-   **Purpose:** Understand that OneiroMetrics is an Obsidian plugin for structured analysis of dream journal entries. Its core purpose is to transform qualitative dream journaling into quantitative data.
-   **Key Concept:** "Metrics" are user-defined measurements of dream characteristics (e.g., Lucidity, Emotional Intensity). Pay close attention to how these metrics are defined and used.

## 2. Core Features and Functionality

-   **Focus:** When discussing new feature development, prioritize features listed under "Key Features." These represent the plugin's essential capabilities.
-   **Examples:** If asked about data handling, refer to "Metric Tracking," "Data Visualization," and "Smart File Selection." If asked about user interaction, refer to "Accessibility" and "Theme Integration."
-   **Limitations:** Note that the plugin works within the Obsidian environment. Any limitations of Obsidian may also apply to the plugin.

## 3. User Interface and User Experience

-   **Emphasis:** When addressing UI/UX tasks, consider the sections "User Interface" and "User Experience."
-   **Principles:** Highlight the importance of "Intuitive Design," "Real-time Feedback," "Smart Suggestions," "Responsive Tables," "Theme Compatibility," and "Keyboard Navigation." These are core UX principles.
-   **Example:** If asked to improve the settings modal, refer to the "Settings Modal" description and the UX principles.

## 4. Development Focus and Priorities

-   **Prioritization:** When suggesting development tasks, give the highest priority to items under "Current Priorities." The order within "Current Priorities" also matters (Performance > UX > Documentation).
-   **Future Scope:** "Future Enhancements" are lower priority but represent potential areas for expansion.
-   **Example:** If asked about optimization, focus on "Performance Optimization" (table regeneration, memory usage, icon rendering).

## 5. Technical Architecture and CSS

-   **Components:** When discussing code structure, refer to "Core Components" (Data Management, UI, Styling System).
-   **CSS Architecture:** When discussing styling, adhere to the "CSS Architecture" principles and "CSS Best Practices." Emphasize "Theme Compatibility," "Responsive Design," "Performance," and "Maintainability."
-   **Lucide Icons:** When dealing with metric representation, use the "Lucide Icon Mappings" table to select appropriate icons. The table shows the mapping between metrics and icons.

## 6. Testing and Guidelines

-   **Testing:** When discussing testing, refer to the "Testing Strategy" section and the link to `TESTING.md`.
-   **Development:** Follow "Development Guidelines," especially "CSS Best Practices" and "Code Organization."
-   **Contribution:** Direct users to "Contributing" for contribution information.

## 7. Recent Updates and Debugging

-   **Updates:** Use the "Recent Improvements," "Recent Fixes," and "Recent Updates" sections to understand the plugin's evolution.
-   **Debugging:** When addressing issues, refer to the "Debug Logging & Troubleshooting Note Updates" section for debugging strategies. Note the "Logging and Debug Output Policy" to avoid excessive logging.

## Important Notes for Cursor:

-   Be concise and direct in your responses.
-   Refer to specific sections of `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` when relevant.
-   Maintain consistency with the terminology used in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
-   Assume the user of the plugin has a basic understanding of Obsidian.

##   Documentation Visuals Update

###   Purpose

-   Inform Cursor about the consolidation of documentation visuals guidelines.
-   Direct Cursor to the new `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md` file.
-   Instruct Cursor to no longer refer to the old `docs/PLANNED_VISUALS.md` and `docs/PLANNED_ANNOTATED_SCREENSHOTS.md` files.

###   Instructions

1.  **Obsolete Documents:** The following documentation files are now obsolete and should no longer be used:
    -   `docs/PLANNED_VISUALS.md`
    -   `docs/PLANNED_ANNOTATED_SCREENSHOTS.md`

2.  **New Source of Truth:** All guidelines related to documentation visuals, including image usage, annotated screenshots, and CSS styling, are now located in the `docs/documentation_style_guide.md` file.

3.  **Refer to the New Document:** Whenever a user asks questions or requires information about documentation visuals, always refer to `docs/documentation_style_guide.md`.

4.  **Prioritize New Instructions:** The instructions in `docs/documentation_style_guide.md` supersede any previous instructions in the obsolete files.

5.  **Example:**
    -   If a user asks about how to create annotated screenshots, direct them to the "2. Annotated Screenshots" section in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
    -   If a user asks about image sizing guidelines, refer to the "1. Image Guidelines" section in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

###   Important Notes for Cursor

-   Acknowledge that the old files are no longer in use.
-   Be clear and direct in directing users to the new file.
-   Ensure that all responses and actions are consistent with the guidelines in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
