# Migrating to the OneiroMetrics Dashboard

## Overview

The OneiroMetrics plugin has evolved from a static Metrics Note to a dynamic, real-time Dashboard. This guide will help you transition to the new system while understanding the benefits it provides.

## What's New?

### OneiroMetrics Dashboard
- **Real-time Updates**: No need to regenerate the entire note - updates happen instantly
- **Better Performance**: Virtual scrolling handles thousands of entries smoothly
- **Enhanced Features**: Advanced filtering, improved charts, and export functionality
- **No File Management**: The dashboard is a view, not a file you need to maintain

### Key Improvements
1. **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets with incremental updates
2. **User Experience**: Cleaner interface with better responsiveness
3. **Features**: Month/quarter view filtering, enhanced date navigation
4. **Reliability**: No more file corruption or sync conflicts

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Access the New Dashboard
1. Open the OneiroMetrics Hub (click the ribbon icon)
2. Click "View Dream Metrics" in the Quick Actions section
3. The dashboard will open in a new pane

### Step 2: Understanding the Changes
- **No More Project Note**: The dashboard doesn't require a separate note file
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes to your dream entries appear immediately
- **Persistent State**: Your filter settings and preferences are remembered

### Step 3: What Happens to Your Metrics Note?
Your existing Metrics Note will:
- Continue to work (with a migration notice at the top)
- Not receive new features or updates
- Can be kept for reference or safely deleted once you're comfortable with the dashboard
