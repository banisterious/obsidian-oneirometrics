# Date Navigator User Guide

The Date Navigator is a calendar-style visualization for your dream journal entries. It provides an intuitive way to browse your dreams by date and quickly filter your data.

## How to Access

You can open the Date Navigator in two ways:

1. Click the calendar icon (ðŸ“…) in the ribbon bar
2. Use the command palette (Ctrl+P) and search for "OneiroMetrics: Open Date Navigator"

The Date Navigator will open in a new pane on the right side of your Obsidian workspace.

## Features

### Calendar View

The Date Navigator displays your dream journal entries in a monthly calendar view:

- Days with dream entries are highlighted
- The current day is outlined
- Selected days are filled with an accent color
- Visual indicators show the number of entries per day
- Quick previews of dream content on hover

### Navigation

- Use the previous (â—€) and next (â–¶) buttons to move between months
- Click the "Today" button to jump to the current month
- Clicking on a date with dream entries will filter your data to show only entries from that day
- Click a selected day to deselect it and clear the filter

### Integration with Filters

The Date Navigator is integrated with the OneiroMetrics filter system:

- Selecting a day in the calendar applies a date filter
- Using quick filters (Today, This Week, etc.) will highlight the corresponding days in the calendar
- Clearing filters deselects any selected days
