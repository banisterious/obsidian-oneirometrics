# Understanding Dream Metrics

> **Applies to:** OneiroMetrics v1.0.0 and above

Dream metrics provide a structured way to quantify and track aspects of your dream experiences over time. By consistently applying these metrics to your dream journal entries, you can uncover patterns, track changes, and gain deeper insights into your dream life.

## What Are Dream Metrics?

Dream metrics are numerical or categorical values assigned to specific aspects of a dream experience. These values help transform subjective experiences into data that can be analyzed, visualized, and compared over time.

Unlike traditional dream journaling, which focuses on narrative descriptions, dream metrics add a quantitative dimension that enables pattern recognition and trend analysis.

## Core Dream Metric Categories

OneiroMetrics includes several categories of metrics to capture different aspects of dream experiences:

### Sensory Experience
- **Sensory Detail (1-5)**: The vividness and richness of sensory experiences (visual, auditory, touch, smell, taste)
- **Visual Clarity (1-5)**: The clarity and detail of visual elements specifically

### Emotional Aspects
- **Emotional Recall (1-5)**: How strongly you can recall the emotions you felt in the dream
- **Emotional Intensity (1-5)**: The strength of emotions experienced during the dream

### Memory and Awareness
- **Dream Recall (1-5)**: Overall completeness of your memory of the dream
- **Lost Segments (Number)**: Number of times you felt parts of the dream were forgotten
- **Confidence Score (1-5)**: How confident you are in your recollection

### Dream Content
- **Descriptiveness (1-5)**: How detailed your written description is
- **Characters Count (Number)**: Number of characters appearing in the dream
- **Familiar Count (Number)**: Number of familiar people or entities
- **Unfamiliar Count (Number)**: Number of unfamiliar entities

### Advanced Metrics
- **Lucidity Level (1-5)**: Degree of awareness that you were dreaming
- **Dream Coherence (1-5)**: How logical or coherent the dream narrative was
- **Environmental Familiarity (1-5)**: How familiar the dream setting was
- **Recall Stability (1-5)**: How stable your memory of the dream has been

## Why Track Dream Metrics?

Tracking dream metrics offers several benefits for self-understanding and research:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns in dream experiences that might not be obvious from descriptions alone
2. **Objective Tracking**: Monitor changes in dream experiences over time with objective measures
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Discover correlations between dream qualities and external factors (stress, sleep quality, etc.)
4. **Targeted Improvement**: For those interested in specific dream skills (like lucid dreaming), metrics provide clear progress indicators
5. **Research Contribution**: Standardized metrics enable contribution to wider dream research

## How Metrics Are Applied

Dream metrics in OneiroMetrics are applied using special callout blocks in your Obsidian notes:

```markdown
> [!dream-metrics]
> Sensory Detail: 4, Emotional Recall: 3, Descriptiveness: 4, Confidence Score: 5
```

These metrics are then extracted, analyzed, and displayed in summary tables, allowing you to:
- View averages across time periods
- Sort dreams by specific metrics
- Filter entries based on metric values
- Identify outlier experiences
- Visualize trends over time

## Creating Your Own Metrics

While OneiroMetrics comes with default metrics, you can create custom metrics to track aspects of your dreams that are personally meaningful:

1. Access Settings → OneiroMetrics → Metrics
2. Click "Add Metric"
3. Define:
   - Name (what you'll track)
   - Icon (visual indicator)
   - Range (measurement scale)
   - Description (what the metric means)

Custom metrics might include:
- **Dream Theme**: Categories like adventure, relationship, fear, etc.
- **Color Intensity**: Vividness of colors in the dream
- **Time Perception**: How time seemed to flow in the dream
- **Body Sensations**: Unusual bodily sensations experienced

## Effective Metric Usage

To get the most from dream metrics:

1. **Be Consistent**: Apply metrics to all dream entries
2. **Rate Promptly**: Score metrics soon after waking when recall is freshest
3. **Define Scales**: Have clear criteria for what each value on your scale means
4. **Balance Metrics**: Use a combination of objective and subjective metrics
5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your metrics data to identify patterns

## The Science Behind Dream Metrics

Dream metrics are inspired by scientific approaches to dream research, including:

- **The Hall/Van de Castle system**: A standardized method for coding dream content
- **Dream Quality Questionnaires**: Research instruments measuring dream recall and qualities
- **Lucidity Scales**: Measures for levels of awareness in dreams

While personal dream metrics may not meet rigorous scientific standards, they provide a structured framework based on established research approaches.
