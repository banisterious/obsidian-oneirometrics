## Adding Dream Metrics

### Callout Format
Use the following format in your dream journal entries:

```markdown
> [!dream-metrics]
> Sensory Detail: 4, Emotional Recall: 3, Lost Segments: 2, Descriptiveness: 3, Confidence Score: 5
```

### Using Templates

OneiroMetrics now provides a powerful template system with Templater integration for creating consistent dream journal entries.

#### Template Wizard

1. Open the Template Wizard using one of these methods:
   - Command palette: "Create Journal Template"
   - Settings page: Templates section
   
2. Follow the step-by-step wizard:
   - Step 1: Enter basic template information (name, description)
   - Step 2: Select a journal structure (flat or nested)
   - Step 3: Configure Templater integration
   - Step 4: Add template content

#### Inserting Templates

Insert templates into your journal entries using:
- Command palette: "Insert Journal Template"
- Editor context menu: "Insert Dream Journal Template"
- Right-click on the OneiroMetrics ribbon icon

#### Templater Integration

For dynamic templates with automatic date insertion, user prompts, and conditional content:

1. **With Templater installed (recommended):**
   - Templates will use Templater's dynamic functionality
   - Date fields will automatically fill with the current date
   - Prompts will ask for information as you insert the template
   - Conditional content will adapt based on your inputs

2. **Without Templater installed (fallback):**
   - Templates will use a static version with placeholders
   - You'll see placeholders like `[[DATE: YYYY-MM-DD]]` instead of dynamic content
   - Tab through placeholders to fill them in manually
   - All essential functionality works, just without automation

#### Template Examples

**Basic Dream Journal Template:**
```markdown
# Dream Journal: <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>

> [!dream]
> <% tp.system.prompt("Describe your dream", "") %>

> [!symbols]
> - <% tp.system.prompt("Symbol 1", "") %>: <% tp.system.prompt("Meaning", "") %>
> - <% tp.system.prompt("Symbol 2", "") %>: <% tp.system.prompt("Meaning", "") %>

> [!metrics]
> Clarity: <% tp.system.prompt("Rate clarity (1-10)", "7") %>
> Vividness: <% tp.system.prompt("Rate vividness (1-10)", "6") %>
> Coherence: <% tp.system.prompt("Rate coherence (1-10)", "5") %>
```

For more detailed information and advanced template techniques, see the [Templater Integration documentation](./TEMPLATER_INTEGRATION.md).

#### Complete Sample Journal Entry

```markdown
---
title: 2025-05-06
tags: [journal, dream, lucid]
date: 2025-05-06
---

> [!journal-entry] 2025-05-06
> ^20250506
> 
> ### 7:00am
>
>> [!dream-diary] Moonlight Painting [[2025-05-06]]
>> I was painting the wind with a brush made of moonlight. Each stroke created invisible ripples that rustled the leaves on silent trees. The colors of the wind were feelings: joy was a vibrant gold, sorrow a deep blue. A flock of paper cranes soared past, carrying the scent of distant memories.
>>
>> [!dream-metrics]
>> Words: 50, Sensory Detail: 3, Emotional Recall: 1, Lost Segments: 3, Descriptiveness: 4, Confidence Score: 5
> 
> ### 5:00pm
> 
> The rain outside mirrors the quiet unease within. Today, the old oak in the backyard seemed to sigh as the wind rustled its new leaves. I found a robin's eggshell, a fragile blue fragment, under the porch swing â€“ a tiny echo of a life begun and ended. The sourdough starter is bubbling vigorously; a small victory in the face of a persistent melancholy I can't quite place. Perhaps a walk in Forest Park tomorrow will shake it off. The scent of damp earth always helps.
> 
> The city hums a low thrum. Coffee steams. The sky, a bruised purple, promises even more rain. A quiet Tuesday unfolds.
```
