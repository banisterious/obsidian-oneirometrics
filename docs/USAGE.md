>> [!dream-diary] Moonlight Painting [[2025-05-06]]
>> I was painting the wind with a brush made of moonlight. Each stroke created invisible ripples that rustled the leaves on silent trees. The colors of the wind were feelings: joy was a vibrant gold, sorrow a deep blue. A flock of paper cranes soared past, carrying the scent of distant memories.

>> [!dream-metrics]
>> Words: 50, Sensory Detail: 3, Emotional Recall: 1, Lost Segments: 3, Descriptiveness: 4, Confidence Score: 5

> ### 5:00pm
> 
> The rain outside mirrors the quiet unease within. Today, the old oak in the backyard seemed to sigh as the wind rustled its new leaves. I found a robin's eggshell, a fragile blue fragment, under the porch swing â€“ a tiny echo of a life begun and ended. The sourdough starter is bubbling vigorously; a small victory in the face of a persistent melancholy I can't quite place. Perhaps a walk in Forest Park tomorrow will shake it off. The scent of damp earth always helps.
> 
> The city hums a low thrum. Coffee steams. The sky, a bruised purple, promises even more rain. A quiet Tuesday unfolds.
