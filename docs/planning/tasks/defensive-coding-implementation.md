# Defensive Coding Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing defensive coding practices across the OneiroMetrics Obsidian Plugin (OOMP).

## Overview

The implementation will follow a phased approach, targeting different components of the application in order of priority. Each phase will focus on making specific components more robust through defensive coding patterns.

## Progress: 90% Complete

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Event Handling System ✅
- Implement EventManager class with error handling ✅
- Create robust EventBus with memory leak prevention ✅
- Define event types and validation ✅
- Incorporate error boundaries for event handlers ✅

### Phase 2: Robust DOM Components ✅
- Create DOMSafetyGuard utility for safe DOM operations ✅
- Implement DOMErrorBoundary component ✅
- Develop NullDOM pattern for fallback rendering ✅
- Enhance existing components with defensive patterns ✅

### Phase 3: State Management Enhancements ✅
- Implement SafeStateManager with validation ✅
- Add transaction support for atomic operations ✅
- Create rollback capabilities for state changes ✅
- Enhance error handling in state transitions ✅

### Phase 4: Parser Components Enhancement ✅
- Enhance ContentParser with defensive patterns ✅
- Create SafeCalloutParser with validation and recovery ✅
- Implement transaction-like parsing with all-or-nothing guarantees ✅
- Add comprehensive error recovery strategies ✅

### Phase 5: API Integration Hardening ⬜
- Implement retry mechanisms for external calls
- Add circuit breaker pattern for failing dependencies
- Create fallback mechanisms for offline operation
- Enhance error reporting for API failures

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation ⬜
- Develop failure injection tests
- Create stress tests for edge cases
- Implement property-based testing
- Add runtime validation mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 5: API Integration Hardening
2. Implement Phase 6: Testing and Validation
3. Conduct full system testing with defensive coding in place

## Dependencies

- SafeLogger module ✅
- ErrorBoundary utilities ✅
- Defensive coding utilities ✅

## Estimated Completion
