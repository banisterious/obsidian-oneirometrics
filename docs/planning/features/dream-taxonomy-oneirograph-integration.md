# Dream Taxonomy & Oneirograph Integration Plan

- **Document Version:** 1.1
- **Date:** August 2025
- **Status:** Phase 3 Complete, Phase 4 Pending
- **Priority:** High
- **Progress:** 3 of 4 phases implemented successfully

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integrated implementation plan for two complementary features: the Dream Taxonomy system and the Oneirograph visualization. Together, these features will provide OneiroMetrics users with a structured yet flexible framework for categorizing their dreams and a powerful visual interface for exploring their dreamscape.

The Dream Taxonomy provides a three-tier hierarchical organization (Clusters → Vectors → Themes), while the Oneirograph creates an interactive, force-directed graph visualization that spatially represents this hierarchy as a navigable "dream landscape."

2. **Visual Exploration**: Enable intuitive navigation of dream data through spatial representation
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Offer immediate value with defaults while supporting advanced customization
4. **Seamless Integration**: Create a unified experience between taxonomy management and visualization

### Key Benefits

- **For New Users**: Immediate structure and guidance for dream categorization
- **For Power Users**: Deep customization and analytical capabilities
- **For Researchers**: Standardized framework for dream analysis and comparison
- **For the Community**: Shareable taxonomies and visualization patterns

## Feature Overview

### Dream Taxonomy System

A hierarchical classification system with three levels:

1. **Clusters** (14 default categories): Broad thematic domains
2. **Vectors** (60+ subcategories): Specific aspects within clusters
3. **Themes** (300+ items): Individual dream elements

**Key Capabilities:**
- Default taxonomy provided out-of-the-box
- Full customization via drag-and-drop interface
- Import/export for sharing
- Multi-vector theme support
- Backward compatibility with existing flat themes

### Oneirograph Visualization

An interactive, force-directed graph that visualizes dreams as nodes within the taxonomy structure:

**Key Features:**
- Spatial clustering based on taxonomy hierarchy
- Progressive detail levels (zoom-dependent)
- Real-time filtering and search
- In-situ dream content expansion
- Connection lines for shared themes
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## User Experience Design

### Taxonomy Editor Workflow

```
1. User opens Settings → Dream Taxonomy
2. Sees tree view with clusters expanded
3. Can drag themes between vectors
4. Changes reflected immediately
5. Auto-save with undo support
6. Export to share with others
```

### Oneirograph Navigation Flow

```
1. User opens Oneirograph view
2. Sees high-level cluster map
3. Clicks cluster to zoom in
4. Sees vectors within cluster
5. Clicks vector to see themes
6. Clicks node to read dream
7. Uses sidebar for filtering
```

### Key UI Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity
2. **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop, click-to-zoom
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time updates, smooth animations
4. **Contextual Help**: Tooltips, guided tours
5. **Keyboard Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation

## Performance Strategy

### Taxonomy Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: Load vectors/themes on demand
- **Indexing**: Build search indices for fast lookup
- **Caching**: Cache computed hierarchies
- **Debouncing**: Batch rapid edits

### Oneirograph Performance

#### Rendering Targets
| Dreams | Initial Load | Pan/Zoom | Filter |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 100    | <500ms      | 60 FPS   | <50ms   |
| 1,000  | <2s         | 30 FPS   | <100ms  |
| 10,000 | <5s         | 20 FPS   | <200ms  |

#### Optimization Techniques

1. **Web Workers**: Offload force calculations
2. **Canvas Layers**: Separate static/dynamic content
3. **Spatial Indexing**: Quadtree for hit detection
4. **LOD System**: Detail based on zoom level
5. **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculate changes

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Taxonomy CRUD operations
   - Force simulation calculations
   - Data model validation
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Integration Tests**

## Design Update: Control Center Integration

**Important UI Location Change (August 2025):**
After review, the Dream Taxonomy management interface will be implemented as a dedicated tab in the Control Center rather than in Settings. This provides:
- Better accessibility and visibility as a core feature
- Larger workspace for complex taxonomy operations  
- Seamless integration with other analytical tools
- Consistent tab-based navigation experience

**Tab Placement:**
The Dream Taxonomy tab will be positioned specifically between the Metrics settings tab and the Reference overview tab in the Control Center:
- Analytics
- Charts  
- Metrics
- **Dream Taxonomy** ← New tab positioned here
- Reference

This placement provides a logical flow from configuration (Metrics) to organization (Dream Taxonomy) to documentation (Reference).

The Oneirograph will remain as a separate view (like Graph View) but may be added as a Control Center tab in a future iteration based on user feedback.

- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions, larger targets
- **Introduction Paragraph**: User guidance explaining hierarchical system

### ✅ Phase 3 Complete (August 2025)

**Status**: Successfully implemented and fully functional
**Branch**: `feature/dream-taxonomy`
**Final Commits**: 
- `82734d6` - "Fix theme extraction to recognize Dream Themes metric"
- `f16efeb` - "Fix Oneirograph file discovery to use recursive folder search" 
- `3e3099e` - "Add vector nodes to Oneirograph visualization"

**What's Working**:
- **Complete Oneirograph View**: Force-directed graph visualization with D3.js simulation
- **Full Node Hierarchy**: Displays clusters (large), vectors (medium), and dreams (small) with proper connections
- **Dynamic Theme Extraction**: Automatically finds user's Dream Themes metric regardless of configuration
- **Recursive File Discovery**: Processes all dream files from subdirectories like the Dashboard
- **Interactive Simulation**: Physics-based positioning with clustering, chronological, and thematic forces
- **Canvas Rendering**: High-performance rendering with CanvasRenderer for large datasets
- **Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing UniversalMetricsCalculator pipeline

**Technical Implementation**:
- `src/dom/oneirograph/OneirographView.ts` - Main view extending ItemView (781 lines)
- `src/dom/oneirograph/ForceSimulation.ts` - D3.js physics simulation (351 lines)  
- `src/dom/oneirograph/CanvasRenderer.ts` - High-performance canvas rendering
- `src/dom/oneirograph/OneirographInteractions.ts` - User interaction handling
- `styles/components/oneirograph.css` - Obsidian-native styling

**Key Features Delivered**:
- **3-Level Hierarchy**: Dreams → Vectors → Clusters (themes implicit in connections)
- **184+ Dreams Processed**: Successfully handles user's full dream dataset
- **Smart Theme Mapping**: Dynamic detection of Dream Themes with malformed data cleanup
- **Performance Optimized**: Canvas rendering with force simulation for smooth interaction

**User Experience**: 
- Opens via ribbon icon to dedicated Oneirograph view
- Interactive graph showing dream relationships through taxonomy
- Visual cluster boundaries with convex hull rendering
- Smooth physics simulation with customizable forces

**Status**: Core dream taxonomy system and basic Oneirograph visualization fully implemented and operational. Phase 4 (advanced Oneirograph features) remains pending.

**Implementation Progress**:
1. ✅ ~~Review and approve plan with Control Center integration~~
2. ✅ ~~Update component designs for tab-based implementation~~
3. ✅ ~~Set up project tracking~~
4. ✅ ~~Begin Phase 1 implementation with new UI location~~
5. ✅ ~~Complete Phase 2 implementation - Taxonomy Editing capabilities~~
6. ✅ ~~Complete Phase 3 implementation - Basic Oneirograph visualization~~
7. **Next**: Begin Phase 4 implementation - Advanced Oneirograph features

**Current Status**: Phases 1-3 successfully implemented. Dream Taxonomy system and basic Oneirograph visualization are complete and operational. Phase 4 (advanced interactions, filtering, enhanced visualization) awaits implementation.
