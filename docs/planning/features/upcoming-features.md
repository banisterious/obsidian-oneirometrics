## Feature Requests

We welcome community input on feature priorities. To suggest features:

1. Check if your idea is already on the roadmap
2. Submit a feature request on our GitHub repository
3. Include use cases and why the feature would be valuable

Features are prioritized based on:
- User demand and feedback
- Technical feasibility
- Alignment with our vision for OneiroMetrics
- Development resources available

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility

All new features are designed with backward compatibility in mind:
- Existing journal entries and formats will continue to work
- Older plugin versions will maintain core functionality
- Data migration tools will be provided when necessary

### Performance Considerations

As we add features, we remain committed to excellent performance:
- Large dream journals must remain responsive
- Mobile devices are considered in design decisions
- Memory usage is carefully monitored
- Features can be selectively enabled/disabled
