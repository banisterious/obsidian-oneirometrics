## Proposed New Metrics
1. **Clarity/Familiarity (1-5 score)** - A measure of how familiar or clear the dream environment/setting felt
2. **Setting Familiarity (1-5 score)** - A measure of how familiar the physical setting/location was

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Settings Module
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Potential Issues**:
- The settings system uses a predefined structure for metrics
- Adding new metrics requires updating both the schema and UI components
- Backwards compatibility with existing settings files
- Default values need to be established

**Mitigation**:
- Follow the exact pattern of existing metrics
- Ensure new metrics are added as disabled by default
- Add appropriate migration code for existing settings
- Add clear documentation for the new metrics

### 2. Metrics Registration
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium

**Potential Issues**:
- Metrics registration happens at plugin initialization
- Any errors during registration could affect the entire metrics system
- Default configuration needs to match user expectations

**Mitigation**:
- Follow existing registration patterns exactly
- Add isolated try/catch blocks during registration
- Log any registration issues clearly
- Use the same metric types as similar existing metrics

### 3. Scraping/Processing Module
**Risk Level**: High

**Potential Issues**:
- Scraping algorithms may be sensitive to new metrics
- NLP/AI processing might need adjustments for the new metrics
- Performance impact of additional metric calculations
- Content parsing logic might need updates

**Mitigation**:
- Make new metrics optional in the processing pipeline
- Add specific fallback logic for each metric
- Test with various content types before release
- Consider adding a feature flag to easily disable if issues arise

### 4. UI/Visualization
**Risk Level**: Low

**Potential Issues**:
- UI components need to accommodate new metrics
- Visualizations may need adjustment for new metric types
- Interactive elements need proper handlers for new metrics

**Mitigation**:
- New metrics follow the same scale (1-5) as existing metrics
- Reuse existing UI patterns for similar metrics
- Ensure proper labeling and tooltips

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Add metrics to settings schema and UI only
2. **Phase 2**: Implement metric calculation in the processing pipeline
3. **Phase 3**: Add visualization and UI components

### Testing Strategy
1. Create mock entries with the new metrics
2. Test settings persistence across plugin reloads
3. Verify scraping correctly calculates the new metrics
4. Validate visualization components display the new metrics correctly

## Fallback Plan
If issues are detected post-implementation:
1. Add a configuration option to disable just the new metrics
2. Prepare a quick-fix release that reverts only the problematic components
3. Have documentation ready explaining how users can disable specific metrics
