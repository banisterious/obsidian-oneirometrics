# Architecture Diagram Update: Types System

**TODO (Post-Refactoring Roadmap: Phase 3 - Documentation Enhancement)**

The architecture diagrams need to be updated to include information about the consolidated types system implemented in Phase 1 of the Post-Refactoring Roadmap.

## Required Updates

1. Add a new diagram showing the types organization:
   - Show the hierarchy of `/src/types/`
   - Illustrate the relationship between core.ts, logging.ts, and journal-check.ts
   - Document how the index.ts exports provide a unified access point

2. Update existing diagrams:
   - Include references to the types system in the Core Interfaces Class Diagram
   - Add the types components to the Component Architecture diagram
   - Update the Data Flow diagram to show how types are used throughout the system

3. Add documentation about the transition:
   - Document the migration from multiple types.ts files to a consolidated approach
   - Explain the deprecation strategy for old type imports

## Implementation Note

This update should be completed as part of Phase 3 (Documentation Enhancement) of the Post-Refactoring Roadmap.
