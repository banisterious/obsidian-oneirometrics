This document tracks technical issues, limitations, and known bugs that have been identified during development activities but have not yet been resolved. These issues are typically internal implementation details rather than user-facing bugs (which are tracked in ISSUES.md).

## Issue Tracking Process

1. Issues are added to this registry when discovered during development activities
2. Each issue receives a unique ID (ISSUE-YY-NNN format)
3. Issues are categorized by type and component
4. When addressed, issues are moved to the "Resolved Issues" section with resolution details
5. Critical issues should also have corresponding entries in the issue tracker

#### Issue Details: REFACTOR-25-001

This is a compound issue affecting multiple components. The refactoring effort that extracted event handlers into separate classes introduced several critical errors that caused the entire metrics note functionality to fail.

**End-User Impact:**
- Dream entries not detected or processed
- "No dream entries to update" error despite valid entries in files
- Empty metrics table or outdated information
- UI components like "Show more" buttons missing
- Date filters and navigation non-functional

**Technical Root Causes:**
- Initialization order failures
- Undefined reference errors
- Service dependency issues
- Parsing engine failures
- UI rendering problems

For complete details on this issue, including analysis, implementation plans, and resolution approach, see the [Scraping and Metrics Note Issues](./implementation/refactoring-lessons-learned.md#1-scraping-and-metrics-note-issues) section in the Refactoring Lessons Learned document.

### CSS Architecture Issues

| ID | Component | Description | Impact | Discovered | Target Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| ISSUE-25-012 | styles.css | Chaotic stylesheet organization with duplications, inconsistent naming, and maintenance difficulties | Medium - Slows development, increases risk of style conflicts, makes responsive design maintenance difficult | 2025-06-15 | 2025-07-01 |

## Implementation Notes

### ISSUE-25-001 & ISSUE-25-002
The failing tests likely have specific expectations about the structure or property values of metrics returned by the standardizeMetric and adaptMetric functions. While our implementation is functionally correct, the tests may be checking for:

1. Specific property ordering
2. Exact property set (no additional properties)
3. Specific default values that may have changed

Resolution approach:
1. Examine test code to identify specific expectations
2. Either update tests to match new implementation or adjust implementation to pass tests
3. Add test documentation to clarify expected behavior

### ISSUE-25-003 (Former Migration Blocker)
This issue was identified as a blocker during the adapter migration plan. The root problem is that two different DreamMetric interfaces exist in the codebase:
- One in `types.ts` (legacy root-level file)
- One in `src/types/core.ts` (new modular approach)

The core version requires an 'enabled' property that was causing TypeScript errors. To unblock the migration, we:
1. Updated the standardizeMetric function to ensure it always returns a complete CoreDreamMetric
2. Fixed createCompatibleMetric to handle null/undefined input values properly
3. Improved adaptMetric to verify all required properties

While these workarounds allowed us to complete the migration, a proper solution would be to:
1. Consolidate the DreamMetric type definitions
2. Update imports across the codebase to use a single definition
3. Remove the dual type system
4. Ensure all functions return properly typed results

### ISSUE-25-004 (Date Range Filter Usability)
The current date range filter UI component has several usability issues:
1. Input fields require exact date formats without clear indication of accepted formats
2. Validation is strict with poor feedback when input is rejected
3. Date selection is cumbersome without a date picker component
4. Error states are not clearly indicated to the user

Resolution approach:
1. Implement a proper date picker component with clear UI for date selection
2. Add inline validation with helpful error messages
3. Support multiple input formats with automatic standardization
4. Add clear visual indication of valid/invalid states
5. Consider replacing with a more user-friendly interface like a calendar view

### ISSUE-25-007 (DateNavigator Type Compatibility)
The DateNavigator.ts file had several type errors related to incompatibilities between the DreamMetricData interface defined in different locations:

1. Main issues:
   - Missing wordCount property on test entries and sample data
   - Type incompatibility between DreamMetricData from '../types' and '../types/core'
   - Different definitions of the source property (string vs string|object)
   - Missing imports for date-fns functions (parseISO, isValid)

2. Resolution details:
   - Created a calculateWordCount utility function in src/utils/helpers.ts to ensure consistent word counting
   - Developed a type adapter in src/utils/type-adapters.ts with adaptDreamMetricData and adaptDreamMetricDataArray functions
   - Updated all test entries and sample data to include the wordCount property
   - Fixed imports in DateNavigator.ts and DateNavigatorIntegration.ts
   - Used the adapter functions to handle type conversions between incompatible interfaces

3. Future recommendations:
   - Consider consolidating the two DreamMetricData interfaces into a single definition
   - Update all imports to use the consolidated type
   - Remove duplicate type definitions to prevent future incompatibilities

### ISSUE-25-012 (CSS Architecture Cleanup)
The styles.css file has grown chaotic during recent development phases, accumulating several maintenance issues:

1. **File Complexity**: Significantly grown during Phase 2 development with scattered organization
2. **Inadvertent Duplications**: Repeated CSS rules from iterative development cycles
3. **Maintenance Difficulty**: Hard to locate and modify specific component styles
4. **Potential Conflicts**: Overlapping selectors and specificity issues

**Impact on Development:**
- Slowed feature development due to CSS complexity
- Risk of style conflicts in new features 
- Difficulty in responsive design maintenance
- Reduced code readability and developer experience

**Resolution Plan:**
A comprehensive 5-phase CSS Refactoring v2 plan has been developed with:
1. **Analysis & Documentation** - Identify all current issues and patterns
2. **Temporary Component Breakdown** - Split into logical component files
3. **Individual Component Cleanup** - Systematic refactoring of each component
4. **Systematic Reassembly** - Merge back to single styles.css with clear organization
5. **Validation & Testing** - Ensure no functionality breaks

**Key Goals:**
- 15-25% file size reduction through duplication elimination
- CSS variable system implementation for design consistency
- Component-based organization with clear documentation
- Zero visual or functional regressions
- Foundation ready for Phase 3 web worker development

For complete details, see the [CSS Refactoring v2 Plan](../planning/css-refactoring-v2-plan.md).

## Resolved Issues

Issues can be resolved in multiple ways:
1. **Fully Fixed**: Issue is completely resolved with a proper implementation
2. **Workaround Applied**: Temporary solution implemented, but may need proper resolution later
3. **No Longer Relevant**: Due to architectural changes or requirement shifts

## Error Handling Approach

All error handling in the OneiroMetrics plugin should follow our [Defensive Coding Practices](../implementation/defensive-coding-practices.md). This comprehensive guide outlines patterns, examples, and utility functions for creating robust, error-resistant code that can gracefully handle unexpected conditions.

Key principles include:
1. Expecting failures and planning for them
2. Providing reasonable fallbacks
3. Containing failures to prevent cascading errors
4. Maintaining user experience through graceful degradation
5. Prioritizing diagnostics with clear error messages

The implementation of these practices is scheduled according to the [Defensive Coding Implementation Plan](../implementation/post-refactoring-roadmap.md#defensive-coding-implementation-plan), which provides a phased approach with concrete timelines and deliverables.

Refer to the defensive coding document for specific implementation guidelines and code examples.
