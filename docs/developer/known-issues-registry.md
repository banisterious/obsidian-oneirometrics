This document tracks technical issues, limitations, and known bugs that have been identified during development activities but have not yet been resolved. These issues are typically internal implementation details rather than user-facing bugs (which are tracked in ISSUES.md).

## Issue Tracking Process

1. Issues are added to this registry when discovered during development activities
2. Each issue receives a unique ID (ISSUE-YY-NNN format)
3. Issues are categorized by type and component
4. When addressed, issues are moved to the "Resolved Issues" section with resolution details
5. Critical issues should also have corresponding entries in the issue tracker

### Scraping and Metrics Note Issues

| ID | Component | Description | Impact | Discovered | Target Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| REFACTOR-25-001 | Event System Refactoring | Complete metrics note failure after refactoring event handling system | Critical - Plugin non-functional for its primary purpose | 2025-05-24 | 2025-07-15 |
| ISSUE-25-014 | UniversalWorkerPool | Background worker script syntax errors causing continuous worker recreation (~90 errors per scrape) | Low - User experience unaffected due to sync fallback; performance overhead acceptable (~10s scraping) | 2025-06-15 | Deferred - Non-critical optimization |

#### Issue Details: REFACTOR-25-001

This is a compound issue affecting multiple components. The refactoring effort that extracted event handlers into separate classes introduced several critical errors that caused the entire metrics note functionality to fail.

**End-User Impact:**
- Dream entries not detected or processed
- "No dream entries to update" error despite valid entries in files
- Empty metrics table or outdated information
- UI components like "Show more" buttons missing
- Date filters and navigation non-functional

**Technical Root Causes:**
- Initialization order failures
- Undefined reference errors
- Service dependency issues
- Parsing engine failures
- UI rendering problems

For complete details on this issue, including analysis, implementation plans, and resolution approach, see the [Scraping and Metrics Note Issues](./implementation/refactoring-lessons-learned.md#1-scraping-and-metrics-note-issues) section in the Refactoring Lessons Learned document.

#### Issue Details: ISSUE-25-014

**UniversalWorkerPool Background Worker Script Errors**

This issue involves background worker script syntax errors that cause continuous worker recreation during scraping operations. Despite the errors, user experience remains unaffected due to effective sync fallback mechanisms.

**Technical Root Cause:**
- Worker scripts fail immediately after instantiation due to syntax errors (likely double-escaped regex patterns)
- Pattern: ~90 worker errors per scrape operation with continuous worker recreation
- Sync fallback system successfully masks the issue from users

**End-User Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **No visible impact** - Charts and tables appear reliably on first try
- ‚úÖ **Acceptable performance** - ~10 second scraping duration
- ‚úÖ **No user-facing errors** - All functionality works as expected

**Current Workaround:**
- Sync fallback processing handles all metrics calculation successfully
- Worker pool errors are logged but don't block functionality
- Performance overhead is acceptable for current use cases

**Investigation Reference:**
For complete technical investigation, root cause analysis, and resolution options, see [UniversalWorkerPool Investigation](./implementation/universal-worker-pool-investigation.md#phase-2-result-processing-pipeline-investigation--resolution).

**Resolution Priority:** Deferred - Low impact optimization rather than critical bug

### CSS Architecture Issues

| ID | Component | Description | Impact | Discovered | Target Resolution |
|----|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|

## Implementation Notes

### ISSUE-25-001 & ISSUE-25-002
The failing tests likely have specific expectations about the structure or property values of metrics returned by the standardizeMetric and adaptMetric functions. While our implementation is functionally correct, the tests may be checking for:

1. Specific property ordering
2. Exact property set (no additional properties)
3. Specific default values that may have changed

Resolution approach:
1. Examine test code to identify specific expectations
2. Either update tests to match new implementation or adjust implementation to pass tests
3. Add test documentation to clarify expected behavior

### ISSUE-25-003 (Former Migration Blocker)
This issue was identified as a blocker during the adapter migration plan. The root problem is that two different DreamMetric interfaces exist in the codebase:
- One in `types.ts` (legacy root-level file)
- One in `src/types/core.ts` (new modular approach)

The core version requires an 'enabled' property that was causing TypeScript errors. To unblock the migration, we:
1. Updated the standardizeMetric function to ensure it always returns a complete CoreDreamMetric
2. Fixed createCompatibleMetric to handle null/undefined input values properly
3. Improved adaptMetric to verify all required properties

While these workarounds allowed us to complete the migration, a proper solution would be to:
1. Consolidate the DreamMetric type definitions
2. Update imports across the codebase to use a single definition
3. Remove the dual type system
4. Ensure all functions return properly typed results

### ISSUE-25-007 (DateNavigator Type Compatibility)
The DateNavigator.ts file had several type errors related to incompatibilities between the DreamMetricData interface defined in different locations:

1. Main issues:
   - Missing wordCount property on test entries and sample data
   - Type incompatibility between DreamMetricData from '../types' and '../types/core'
   - Different definitions of the source property (string vs string|object)
   - Missing imports for date-fns functions (parseISO, isValid)

2. Resolution details:
   - Created a calculateWordCount utility function in src/utils/helpers.ts to ensure consistent word counting
   - Developed a type adapter in src/utils/type-adapters.ts with adaptDreamMetricData and adaptDreamMetricDataArray functions
   - Updated all test entries and sample data to include the wordCount property
   - Fixed imports in DateNavigator.ts and DateNavigatorIntegration.ts
   - Used the adapter functions to handle type conversions between incompatible interfaces

3. Future recommendations:
   - Consider consolidating the two DreamMetricData interfaces into a single definition
   - Update all imports to use the consolidated type
   - Remove duplicate type definitions to prevent future incompatibilities

### ISSUE-25-013 (Enhanced Date Navigator Keyboard Navigation)
This issue affects keyboard accessibility in the Enhanced Date Navigator modal when using dual or quarter view modes.

**Problem Description:**
- Users can tab to individual month grids in dual/quarter view
- Arrow key navigation does not work properly within month grids
- Tab navigation works between grids but arrow keys should work within each grid independently
- Affects screen reader users and keyboard-only navigation

**Resolution Attempts Made:**
1. **Initial Fix**: Added basic keyboard navigation with `setupCompactCalendarAccessibility` method
2. **Enter/Space Behavior**: Fixed Enter/Space to select dates instead of switching view modes
3. **Inter-Grid Navigation**: Implemented coordinated tab order system between multiple grids
4. **Visual Feedback**: Added focus event handlers for immediate visual feedback
5. **Scope Isolation**: Updated `getAdjacentCompactCell` to use `closest('.oomp-compact-days-container')` instead of `parentElement`
6. **Architecture Simplification**: Removed complex roving tabindex management in favor of simpler approach

**Current Status:**
Despite multiple incremental fixes addressing different aspects (scoping, event handling, visual feedback, tabindex management), the core keyboard navigation within month grids remains non-functional. The issue may require fundamental architectural changes to the accessibility pattern rather than incremental fixes.

**Recommended Future Approach:**
- Consider complete rewrite of compact calendar accessibility implementation
- Investigate whether DOM structure conflicts with accessibility patterns
- May need to separate single-month and multi-month accessibility implementations entirely
- Test with actual screen reader software to validate proper ARIA implementation

**Files Affected:**
- `src/dom/modals/EnhancedDateNavigatorModal.ts` (multiple methods)
- `styles/enhanced-date-navigator.css` (focus styles)

**Workaround:**
Users can still use Tab key to navigate between grids and Enter/Space to select dates. Mouse/touch interaction remains fully functional.

## Error Handling Approach

All error handling in the OneiroMetrics plugin should follow our [Defensive Coding Practices](../implementation/defensive-coding-practices.md). This comprehensive guide outlines patterns, examples, and utility functions for creating robust, error-resistant code that can gracefully handle unexpected conditions.

Key principles include:
1. Expecting failures and planning for them
2. Providing reasonable fallbacks
3. Containing failures to prevent cascading errors
4. Maintaining user experience through graceful degradation
5. Prioritizing diagnostics with clear error messages

The implementation of these practices is scheduled according to the [Defensive Coding Implementation Plan](../implementation/post-refactoring-roadmap.md#defensive-coding-implementation-plan), which provides a phased approach with concrete timelines and deliverables.

Refer to the defensive coding document for specific implementation guidelines and code examples.
