## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Table Rendering Issues

1. **Problem**: Table doesn't appear or is incomplete
   **Solution**: Ensure you're in Reading View mode, not Live Preview

2. **Problem**: "Show more" button doesn't expand content
   **Solution**: 
   - Set logging level to Debug in settings
   - Click the "Debug: Attach Show More Listeners" button
   - Check console for errors
   - Try reloading the note

3. **Problem**: Sorting or filtering doesn't update the table
   **Solution**: 
   - Check for console errors
   - Try toggling between filters a few times
   - Reload the note

#### Settings Issues

1. **Problem**: File suggestions don't appear
   **Solution**:
   - Click in another field and then back
   - Try typing more characters
   - Check console for errors

2. **Problem**: Selected notes aren't saved
   **Solution**:
   - Ensure chips are created by pressing Enter
   - Check for console errors about invalid paths
   - Try restarting Obsidian

#### Templater Integration Issues

1. **Problem**: Templates don't process correctly
   **Solution**:
   - Verify Templater is installed and enabled
   - Check template syntax for errors
   - Try using a simpler template to isolate the issue

2. **Problem**: Static placeholders don't appear
   **Solution**:
   - Check template conversion in settings
   - Try recreating the template
   - Verify placeholder format is correct

#### Performance Issues

1. **Problem**: Slow scraping with large journals
   **Solution**:
   - Try scraping fewer notes at once
   - Check for complex callout nesting
   - Monitor memory usage

2. **Problem**: Table is laggy with many entries
   **Solution**:
   - Ensure virtualization is working (only ~12 rows in DOM)
   - Use filters to reduce visible entries
   - Check for console warnings about long tasks
