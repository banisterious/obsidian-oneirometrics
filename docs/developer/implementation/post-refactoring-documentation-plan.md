Progress is tracked through various tables throughout this document, with an overall status summary at the end.

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for reorganizing documentation and updating diagrams after the successful completion of the TypeScript refactoring project. It serves as a checklist and guide for ensuring our documentation accurately reflects the new architecture.

  - [ ] Catalog key information, decisions, and patterns in each document
  - [ ] Identify content that should be preserved in permanent documentation
  - [ ] Create a migration plan for valuable content from each document
  - [ ] Ensure architecture docs capture all important design decisions
