## Document Reorganization

### Audit Documents for Unique Content
- [ ] Review all refactoring documents to identify unique information:
  - [ ] Catalog key information, decisions, and patterns in each document
  - [ ] Identify content that should be preserved in permanent documentation
  - [ ] Create a migration plan for valuable content from each document
  - [ ] Ensure architecture docs capture all important design decisions

### Audit Tracking Table
| Document | Reviewed | Unique Content Summary | Migration Destination | Migration Status |
|----------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
