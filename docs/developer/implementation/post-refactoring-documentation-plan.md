## Document Reorganization

### Audit Documents for Unique Content
- [x] Review all refactoring documents to identify unique information:
  - [x] Catalog key information, decisions, and patterns in each document
  - [x] Identify content that should be preserved in permanent documentation
  - [x] Create a migration plan for valuable content from each document
  - [x] Ensure architecture docs capture all important design decisions

### Audit Tracking Table
| Document | Reviewed | Unique Content Summary | Migration Destination | Migration Status |
|----------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
