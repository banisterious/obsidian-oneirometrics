# OneiroMetrics Tables Functionality Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-05-24

## Overview
This document captures the results of manual testing for the Metrics Tables functionality in OneiroMetrics following the TypeScript refactoring.

## Test Environment
- Obsidian v1.4.0+
- Windows 10.0.26100
- OneiroMetrics plugin (refactoring/2025-typescript branch)

## Test Results

### 1. Summary Metrics Table
- **Result**: **Failed**
- **Details**:
  - ❌ Summary metrics table is completely missing from the metrics note
  - ❌ Unable to verify metrics calculations
  - ❌ Cannot test sorting or filtering of metrics data

### 2. Detailed Metrics Table (Dream Entries)
- **Result**: **Partial Pass**
- **Details**:
  - ✅ Dream entries table is visible
  - ❌ Table displays raw HTML instead of properly rendered content
  - ❌ Cannot verify if all entries are correctly included
  - ❌ Cannot verify if all metrics are correctly calculated and displayed

### 3. Table Functionality
- **Result**: **Could Not Test**
- **Details**:
  - ❌ Unable to test table sorting due to rendering issues
  - ❌ Cannot verify lazy loading for large datasets
  - ❌ Cannot test expand/collapse functionality for entries

## Critical Issues Identified
1. Summary metrics table is completely missing
2. Detailed metrics table (dream entries) has rendering issues
3. Unable to verify basic table functionality
4. This is a core functionality requirement for the merge criteria

## Next Steps
- Investigate why summary metrics table is not being generated
- Fix HTML rendering issues in the dream entries table
- Verify metrics calculation logic in the codebase
- Prioritize fixing these issues as they affect core functionality
- Re-test after fixes have been implemented

## Additional Notes
- This issue appears to be related to the overall problems with metrics note generation
- The absence of a proper summary table prevents users from seeing aggregate metrics
- The raw HTML display in the entries table makes it difficult to read and use
- These tables are essential for the core functionality of the plugin
