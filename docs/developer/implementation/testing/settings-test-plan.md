## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the OneiroMetrics Settings component following the TypeScript refactoring. The plan focuses on verifying the functionality, reliability, and integrity of the settings system after the implementation of the adapter pattern and interface standardization.

## Test Environment Requirements

- Obsidian v1.4.0+
- Clean test vault with no existing OneiroMetrics settings
- Test vault with existing pre-refactoring settings
- Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
- Test data generator for creating large datasets

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests

Implement automated unit tests for:
- All helper functions in settings-helpers.ts
- The adaptSettingsToCore function in type-adapters.ts
- Settings migration functions

### Phase 2: Integration Tests

Implement integration tests for:
- Settings persistence across plugin reloads
- Settings UI interaction tests
- Settings impact on component behavior

### Phase 3: Manual Verification

Perform manual verification of:
- End-to-end settings workflows
- Settings UI responsiveness and usability
- Error scenarios and recovery

## Test Data Requirements

- Sample settings objects from v0.9.x
- Sample settings objects from v1.0.x
- Corrupted settings data samples
- Minimal and maximal settings configurations

## Expected Results Documentation

For each test, document:
1. Test ID and description
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected outcome
4. Actual outcome
5. Pass/Fail status
6. Environment details
7. Screenshots or logs (if applicable)

## Issues and Defect Tracking

All identified issues should be:
1. Documented with reproducible steps
2. Categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Linked to the specific test case that identified them
4. Assigned a priority for resolution

## Test Schedule

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Deliverables |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Unit Test Implementation | [TBD] | [TBD] | Automated test suite for helpers and adapters |
| Integration Test Implementation | [TBD] | [TBD] | Automated test suite for settings integration |
| Manual Testing | [TBD] | [TBD] | Completed test matrices and issue reports |
| Regression Testing | [TBD] | [TBD] | Verification that fixed issues remain resolved |

## Success Criteria

The settings component testing will be considered successful when:
- All high-priority tests pass
- No critical defects remain unresolved
- Settings persistence works reliably across environments
- Settings adapter pattern correctly handles all property scenarios
- UI elements correctly reflect and update settings
- Settings changes properly propagate to dependent components
