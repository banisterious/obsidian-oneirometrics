# OneiroMetrics Scraping Functionality Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-05-24

## Overview
This document captures the results of manual testing for the Dream Scraping functionality in OneiroMetrics following the TypeScript refactoring.

## Test Environment
- Obsidian v1.4.0+
- Windows 10.0.26100
- OneiroMetrics plugin (refactoring/2025-typescript branch)

## Test Results

### 1. Interface Verification
- **Result**: **Partial Pass**
- **Details**:
  - ✅ Ribbon button correctly opens the Dream Journal Manager modal
  - ✅ Navigation to the Dream Scrape tab works properly
  - ✅ Selection mode dropdown (notes vs. folder) functions correctly
  - ✅ Note selection with autocomplete works properly

### 2. Scrape Operation
- **Result**: **Partial Pass**
- **Details**:
  - ✅ Scrape operation initiates correctly
  - ✅ Progress appears to be reported correctly
  - ✅ Operation completes without errors
  - ❌ The resulting metrics note displays raw HTML in reading view

### 3. Metrics Display
- **Result**: **Failed**
- **Details**:
  - ❌ Metrics table/summary is not displayed
  - ❌ No headings are visible
  - ❌ No filters are present
  - ✅ Dream entries table is visible
  - ❌ Raw HTML is visible instead of properly rendered content

## Critical Issues Identified
1. Metrics note displays raw HTML instead of properly rendered content
2. Metrics summary table is completely missing
3. Headings and filters are missing from the metrics note

## Next Steps
- Investigate HTML rendering issue in the metrics note
- Determine why metrics summary, headings, and filters are not being generated
- Prioritize fixing these issues as they affect core functionality
- Re-test after fixes have been implemented

## Additional Notes
- The scraping operation itself appears to work correctly
- The UI components in the Dream Journal Manager modal function as expected
- The issue appears to be with the generation or rendering of the metrics note content
