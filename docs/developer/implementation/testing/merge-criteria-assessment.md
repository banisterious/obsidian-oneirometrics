# OneiroMetrics TypeScript Refactoring Merge Criteria Assessment

## Test Date: 2025-05-24

## Overview
This document assesses the current state of the OneiroMetrics plugin refactoring against the established merge criteria. The assessment is based on manual testing of core functionality identified in the [Testing Documentation - Merge Criteria](./index.md#merge-criteria) document.

## Test Environment
- Obsidian v1.4.0+
- Windows 10.0.26100
- OneiroMetrics plugin (refactoring/2025-typescript branch)

## Merge Criteria Assessment

### 1. Settings System Verification
- **Overall Status**: **Partially Meets Criteria**
- **Summary**:
  - ✅ Settings persistence functions correctly for existing and new settings
  - ✅ Settings UI components render (with some issues)
  - ❌ Helper functions have issues with default values
  - ❌ Migration from older versions fails
  - ❌ Various UI issues (missing metrics lists, reappearing deprecated fields)
- **Detailed Results**: [Settings Test Results](./settings-test-plan.md#test-results-2025-05-24)

### 2. Basic Scraping Functionality
- **Overall Status**: **Partially Meets Criteria**
- **Summary**:
  - ✅ Basic scraping UI loads correctly
  - ✅ Scraping operation executes without errors
  - ❌ Output display has critical rendering issues
- **Detailed Results**: [Scraping Test Results](./scraping-test-results.md)

### 3. Metrics Tables Generation
- **Overall Status**: **Does Not Meet Criteria**
- **Summary**:
  - ❌ Summary metrics table is completely missing
  - ❌ Detailed metrics table has rendering issues (raw HTML)
  - ❌ Cannot verify table functionality
- **Detailed Results**: [Tables Test Results](./tables-test-results.md)

### 4. Basic Filters
- **Overall Status**: **Does Not Meet Criteria**
- **Summary**:
  - ❌ Filter interface is completely missing
  - ❌ Cannot test filter functionality
- **Detailed Results**: [Filters Test Results](./filters-test-results.md)

## Overall Assessment
Based on the testing conducted, the current state of the refactoring **does not meet the established merge criteria**. While some components show partial functionality, critical features like metrics tables and filters are non-functional or missing entirely.

## Critical Issues Summary
1. **Settings System**:
   - Missing metrics lists in settings UI
   - Deprecated fields reappearing
   - Migration from older versions failing
   - Helper functions not providing default values

2. **Scraping**:
   - Metrics note displays raw HTML instead of rendered content

3. **Metrics Tables**:
   - Summary metrics table completely missing
   - Dream entries table shows raw HTML
   - Unable to verify table functionality

4. **Filters**:
   - Filter interface completely missing
   - Unable to test filtering functionality

## Recommendations
1. **Do Not Merge**: The current state of the refactoring does not meet the established criteria for merging to the main branch.

2. **Prioritize Fixes**:
   - Fix HTML rendering in metrics notes
   - Restore missing summary metrics table
   - Restore filter functionality
   - Address settings system issues (migration, missing UI elements)

3. **Re-Test After Fixes**: Conduct comprehensive testing of all core functionality after implementing fixes.

4. **Focus on Core Requirements**: Prioritize the four core areas identified in the merge criteria before addressing other issues.

## Next Steps
1. Document these findings in the project tracking system
2. Create specific tickets for each critical issue
3. Prioritize fixes based on the merge criteria requirements
4. Schedule a follow-up testing session after fixes are implemented

## Additional Notes
- The basic infrastructure appears to be in place (modal loading, scraping execution)
- Issues appear to be primarily with output generation and rendering
- Some settings functionality works correctly despite the identified issues
- A systematic approach to fixing each core area is recommended
