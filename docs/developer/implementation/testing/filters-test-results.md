# OneiroMetrics Filters Functionality Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-05-24

## Overview
This document captures the results of manual testing for the Filters functionality in OneiroMetrics following the TypeScript refactoring.

## Test Environment
- Obsidian v1.4.0+
- Windows 10.0.26100
- OneiroMetrics plugin (refactoring/2025-typescript branch)

## Test Results

### 1. Filter Interface Verification
- **Result**: **Failed**
- **Details**:
  - ❌ No filter options are visible in the metrics note
  - ❌ Date filters are completely missing
  - ❌ Metric value filters are not present

### 2. Filter Functionality
- **Result**: **Could Not Test**
- **Details**:
  - ❌ Unable to test filter functionality due to missing interface elements
  - ❌ Cannot verify if filtering logic works correctly

## Critical Issues Identified
1. Filter interface is completely missing from the metrics note
2. Unable to filter dream entries by date or metrics values
3. This is a core functionality requirement for the merge criteria

## Next Steps
- Investigate why filter components are not being generated
- Check if the filter logic is still intact in the codebase
- Prioritize fixing these issues as they affect core functionality
- Re-test after fixes have been implemented

## Additional Notes
- This issue appears to be related to the overall problems with metrics note generation
- The absence of filters means users cannot perform basic data analysis tasks
- This functionality is listed as a core requirement in the merge criteria document
