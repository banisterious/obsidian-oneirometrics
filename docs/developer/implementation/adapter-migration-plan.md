## Overview

During the 2025 TypeScript refactoring project, we created several adapter files to maintain backward compatibility while transitioning to a more modular, type-safe architecture. These adapter files were intended as temporary bridges but have become tightly integrated into the codebase.

This plan outlines our strategy for:
1. Identifying all dependencies on adapter files
2. Classifying adapter functions as permanent or temporary
3. Creating proper replacements for essential functionality
4. Systematically updating imports and references
5. Safely removing temporary adapter code
6. Verifying functionality throughout the process

## Classification Strategy

Each adapter function is classified into one of three categories:

### Keep
Functions that should remain as permanent parts of the codebase because they provide essential functionality that will be needed long-term.

**Criteria for "Keep":**
- Used throughout the codebase in critical components
- Provides backward compatibility that will be needed for user data
- Implements functionality that has no better alternative

### Refactor
Functions that should be reimplemented in a more appropriate location with better typing and documentation.

**Criteria for "Refactor":**
- Currently implemented as an adapter but represents core functionality
- Would benefit from improved typing and proper integration
- Should be moved to a more logical module

### Remove
Functions that were created solely for the migration and can be safely removed once dependencies are updated.

**Criteria for "Remove":**
- Created specifically to bridge old and new code during migration
- Has a clear replacement in the new architecture
- Only used in a few specific places that can be easily updated

### Classification Tracking Table

| Function | Classification | Rationale | Next Steps |
|----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| ContentParserAdapter.adaptExtractDreamEntries | Remove | Temporary bridge for parameter mismatches | Update ContentParser to handle parameter variations directly |
| UIComponentAdapter.adaptMetricForUI | Refactor | Core functionality, poor location | Move to MetricComponent as a proper method |
| SettingsAdapter.adaptSelectionMode | Keep | Critical for backward compatibility | Move to selection-mode-helpers.ts |
| adaptSettingsToCore | Refactor | Core functionality, should be in state/adapters | Create proper SettingsAdapter class in state/adapters |
| getProjectNotePathSafe | Keep | Essential for backward compatibility | Already properly placed in settings-helpers.ts |
| getPropertyCompatibly | Refactor | Core functionality for property access | Create proper PropertyAccessor class |
| createCompatibleComponent | Remove | Temporary bridge for component creation | Update component creation in UI modules |

## Model Adapter Patterns

To guide our adapter migration work, we've identified selection-mode-helpers.ts as a model adapter implementation that exemplifies best practices for maintaining compatibility while ensuring type safety and usability.

### Reference Implementation: selection-mode-helpers.ts

The selection-mode-helpers.ts file addresses a critical compatibility issue in the codebase: two different naming conventions for selection modes are used throughout the app:
- Modern/UI naming: 'notes' and 'folder'
- Legacy/internal naming: 'manual' and 'automatic'

This adapter provides a complete set of utilities for working with these dual naming conventions:

```typescript
// Basic type checks
isFolderMode(mode: SelectionMode): boolean
isNotesMode(mode: SelectionMode): boolean

// Equivalence checking
areSelectionModesEquivalent(mode1: SelectionMode, mode2: SelectionMode): boolean

// UI presentation
getSelectionModeLabel(mode: SelectionMode): string
getSelectionModeDescription(mode: SelectionMode): string

// Normalization
normalizeSelectionMode(mode: SelectionMode): 'manual' | 'automatic'
normalizeLegacySelectionMode(mode: SelectionMode): 'notes' | 'folder'
getCompatibleSelectionMode(mode: string, format: 'ui' | 'internal'): string
```

### Key Characteristics of Successful Adapters

Based on our analysis of selection-mode-helpers.ts, we've identified these key characteristics that make it a successful adapter pattern:

1. **Narrow focus**: Addresses a single, specific compatibility issue
2. **Comprehensive coverage**: Provides all operations needed for the domain (checking, converting, displaying)
3. **Well-documented**: Each function has clear JSDoc comments explaining purpose and parameters
4. **Type safety**: Uses proper TypeScript types throughout
5. **Abstraction**: Hides the complexity of dual naming systems from consuming code
6. **Zero dependencies**: Only depends on core types, not on other adapters
7. **Symmetrical API**: Provides both "get" and "normalize" operations for bidirectional compatibility

### Usage Patterns to Adopt

When implementing new adapter functions or refactoring existing ones, follow these patterns:

```typescript
// AVOID direct comparisons with multiple values:
if (mode === 'notes' || mode === 'manual') {
  // ...
}

// PREFER adapter functions:
if (isNotesMode(mode)) {
  // ...
}

// AVOID direct property access with fallbacks:
const projectPath = settings.projectNote || settings.projectNotePath || '';

// PREFER helper functions:
const projectPath = getProjectNotePath(settings);
```

### Adapter Design Guidelines

When creating or refactoring adapters, follow these guidelines:

1. **Function naming**:
   - Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
   - Use prefixes like "is", "get", "normalize" to indicate function type

2. **Parameter consistency**:
   - Keep parameter order consistent across related functions
   - Use explicit type annotations for parameters and return values

3. **Documentation**:
   - Include JSDoc comments for all exported functions
   - Document parameters and return values
   - Explain any non-obvious behavior or edge cases

4. **Error handling**:
   - Provide reasonable defaults for missing or invalid values
   - Use type guards to ensure type safety

5. **Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for all adapter functions
   - Test with various input combinations including edge cases

By following these patterns and guidelines, we'll create adapters that are maintainable, type-safe, and facilitate the gradual migration to our new architecture.

### Dependency Analysis Methodology

To identify adapter file dependencies, we use a combination of:
1. Static code analysis using grep/search
2. Manual code review for context
3. Automated TypeScript dependency tracking

For each adapter function, we document:
- Files that import it
- How it's used in those files
- What would be required to replace it
- Potential risks in migration
