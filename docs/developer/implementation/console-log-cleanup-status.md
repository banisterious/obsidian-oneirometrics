# Console.log Cleanup Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of replacing console.log statements with structured logging throughout the OneiroMetrics codebase. The goal is to use the structured logging system designed in accordance with the architecture requirements documented in `docs/developer/implementation/logging.md`.

## Current Status (2025-05-28)

| Category | Initial Count | Current Count | Remaining | Progress |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| console.log | 65 | 40 | 25 | 62% |
| console.warn | 8 | 3 | 5 | 63% |
| console.error | 37 | 30 | 7 | 81% |
| console.info | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| console.debug | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| **Total** | 114 | 77 | 37 | 68% |

## Remaining Files with Console Statements

| File | Count | Priority | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| src/logging/adapters/ConsoleAdapter.ts | 7 | Low | Intentional part of logging system |
| src/logging/safe-logger.ts | 7 | Low | Intentional fallback mechanism |
| main.ts | 2 | Medium | Debug utility functions |
| src/journal_check/types.ts | 1 | Low | Deprecation warning |

## Implementation Notes

When replacing console.log statements, follow these patterns:

1. **Import the logger**:
   ```typescript
   import { getLogger } from '../logging';
   ```

2. **Create a logger instance**:
   ```typescript
   const logger = getLogger('ComponentName');
   ```

3. **Replace console.log with appropriate level**:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   console.log(`Test '${test.name}' completed`);
   
   // After
   logger.debug('Category', `Test '${test.name}' completed`);
   ```

4. **Use consistent categories**:
   - 'Test' - For test-related logging
   - 'EdgeCase' - For edge case testing
   - 'UI' - For UI components
   - 'DOM' - For DOM manipulation
   - 'Parser' - For content parsing
   - 'Metrics' - For metrics operations
   - 'Settings' - For settings operations
   - 'Template' - For template operations

5. **Include relevant context data**:
   ```typescript
   logger.debug('Category', 'Message', { contextData });
   ```

## Known Issues

### DateNavigator.ts Linter Errors

The DateNavigator.ts file has been updated to use the structured logging system, and we've fixed the missing date-fns imports (parseISO and isValid). However, there are still type-related linter errors regarding the DreamMetricData type and missing wordCount properties. These need more significant changes to resolve.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix DateNavigator.ts Linter Errors** (High Priority)
   - Resolve type incompatibility issues between different DreamMetricData versions
   - Add wordCount to test entries

2. **Update main.ts Debug Functions** (Medium Priority)
   - Replace 2 console statements with structured logging

3. **Document Intentional Exceptions** (Low Priority)
   - Add comments to ConsoleAdapter.ts and safe-logger.ts
   - Clearly mark these as intentional parts of the logging system

## Conclusion

The console.log cleanup has made significant progress, with 37 out of 114 console statements now using the structured logging system across multiple files. We've cleaned up test modules, the DateNavigator, and UI components in the journal_check system.

The remaining console statements are primarily in the logging system itself (intentional) and a few isolated instances in main.ts and types.ts.
