# OneiroMetrics Performance Optimization Plan

> **NOTE:** This is a placeholder plan for future performance optimization work. This plan will be expanded and refined when the optimization phase begins.

## Key Performance Areas

### 1. Startup Time Optimization
- [ ] Profile plugin startup sequence
- [ ] Identify slow-loading components
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize settings loading and migration
- [ ] Reduce initial DOM manipulation

### 2. Journal Processing Performance
- [ ] Benchmark large journal processing
- [ ] Implement incremental processing for large files
- [ ] Optimize content parsing algorithms
- [ ] Add caching for parsed journal entries
- [ ] Implement background processing for non-UI blocking operations

### 3. UI Rendering Performance
- [ ] Profile UI component render times
- [ ] Optimize DOM manipulation in metrics tables
- [ ] Implement virtualization for large data sets
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimize CSS selectors and animations

### 4. Memory Usage Optimization
- [ ] Profile memory usage during different operations
- [ ] Identify memory leaks and unnecessary object retention
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup for unused resources
- [ ] Optimize data structures for large journals
- [ ] Reduce duplicate data in memory

### 5. Storage and I/O Optimization
- [ ] Optimize file read/write operations
- [ ] Implement efficient data serialization
- [ ] Add compression for large datasets
- [ ] Implement incremental state persistence
- [ ] Optimize backup operations

## Implementation Approach

When this plan is activated, we will:

1. Establish performance baselines through benchmarking
2. Identify the highest-impact optimization opportunities
3. Implement optimizations in order of impact-to-effort ratio
4. Measure improvements against the baseline
5. Document optimization techniques for future reference

## Success Criteria

The optimization effort will be considered successful when:
- Plugin startup time is reduced by at least 40%
- Processing time for large journals (1000+ entries) is reduced by at least 50%
- UI interactions remain responsive even with large datasets
- Memory usage is kept within reasonable limits even for very large journals
- No regressions in functionality are introduced
