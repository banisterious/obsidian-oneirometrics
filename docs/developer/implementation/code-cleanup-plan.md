## Types of Dead Code

Our analysis identified several categories of dead code in the codebase:

1. **Debug Console.log Statements**
   - Numerous `console.log` statements used for debugging
   - Should be replaced with proper logging using the LoggingService

2. **Commented-Out Code**
   - Code blocks that are commented out but kept "just in case"
   - Redundant with version control, should be removed

3. **Redundant Imports**
   - Multiple import statements from the same module
   - Can be consolidated for better readability and reduced bundle size

4. **Transitional Code**
   - Code kept during transitions (e.g., from types.ts refactoring)
   - Can now be fully migrated and the transitional code removed

5. **Unused Functions and Variables**
   - Functions and variables that are defined but never used
   - Should be identified and removed

6. **Outdated TODOs**
   - TODO comments for tasks that have been completed or abandoned
   - Should be addressed or removed

## Implementation Strategy

We will adopt a systematic approach to eliminate dead code:

1. **Audit and Document**
   - Run automated tools to identify dead code
   - Document findings for review
   - Prioritize areas with highest dead code concentration

2. **Iterative Cleanup**
   - Work module by module
   - Focus on one type of dead code at a time
   - Create automated tests where necessary
   - Verify each change with manual testing

3. **Validation**
   - Ensure functionality is preserved
   - Update documentation to reflect changes
   - Run the test suite to catch regressions

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain detailed progress notes in this document for developers
   - Keep CHANGELOG.md entries concise and focused on user-facing changes
   - Document internal implementation details here rather than in CHANGELOG

## Priority Areas

Based on initial analysis, these areas have the highest concentration of dead code:

1. **Main.ts**
   - Contains multiple console.log statements
   - Has potentially unused legacy functions

2. **Types Files**
   - Old type definitions in multiple files
   - Bridge code that should be consolidated

3. **Events and DOM Components**
   - Debug logging that should use LoggingService
   - Potentially redundant event handlers

4. **Journal Check Module**
   - Transitional code from "Linting" to "Journal Structure Check"
   - Redundant imports and unused functions

**Summary Status (2025-05-27):**
Phase 3 (Transitional Code Removal) is complete with the migration to the consolidated type system. We've made significant progress on Phase 1 (Logging Cleanup) by replacing critical console.log statements with structured logging in main.ts and other core files. Phase 4 (Unused Code Elimination) has started with the removal of unused methods in DreamMetricsState and updating dependencies to address security issues.

The remaining tasks are:
1. Complete replacement of debug console.log statements in UI-related code
2. Remove remaining unused code identified through analysis
3. Add better log-level controls for filtering debug messages
4. Address TypeScript errors that still exist in the codebase

## Success Criteria

The dead code elimination phase will be considered successful when:

1. All `console.log` statements have been replaced with proper logging
2. Redundant imports have been consolidated
3. Transitional code has been removed
4. No unused functions remain in the codebase
5. All TODOs have been addressed or documented in ISSUES.md
6. The codebase passes all tests and functions as expected

## Next Steps

1. Continue replacing remaining console.log statements with structured logging
2. Remove remaining identified unused code
3. Fix TypeScript errors in the codebase
4. Add better log level controls for filtering debug messages
5. Update documentation to reflect the changes 

**Progress (2025-05-28):**

- Create classification table (keep, refactor, remove) for adapter functionality
- Implement permanent replacements for essential adapter functionality
- Update imports one file at a time, starting with non-critical components
- Remove adapter files once all dependencies have been updated 

**Progress (2025-05-25):**
- Refactored date handling functions in main.ts to use centralized utilities
  - Replaced local validateDate, parseDate, and formatDate implementations with imports from src/utils/date-utils.ts
  - Updated method references across the file to use the shared utilities
  - Added proper null handling for parseDate return values

### Commented Code Blocks

We found primarily documentation comments related to TypeScript interfaces rather than commented-out code blocks. The commented-code analysis should be run again with adjusted parameters to better identify actual code blocks.

| File | Lines | Type | Status | Assignee | Notes |
|------|-------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| src/journal_check/types.ts | 1-4 | Multi-line | Pending | | Deprecation notice for types file |
| src/types.ts | 1-4 | Multi-line | Pending | | Deprecation notice for types file |
| main.ts | 3820-3824 | Multi-line | Pending | | Debug function accessible from console |

#### Commented Code Statistics

- Most comments are properly formatted TypeScript documentation (JSDoc style)
- 3 deprecation notices for files being phased out
- Several commented-out code snippets that appear to be examples rather than dead code

*Note: Run `.\utils\find-commented-code.ps1` for the complete list*

### Outdated TODOs

No TODOs were found in the codebase during our scan. This suggests that the team has been diligent about addressing TODOs as part of the refactoring process.

*Note: Run `.\utils\find-outdated-todos.ps1` to verify*

## Cleanup Process

To update the status of items in these tracking tables:

1. Identify a batch of related items to clean up (e.g., console.log statements in a specific file)
2. Update the "Status" column to "In Progress" and add your name to "Assignee"
3. Make the necessary code changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit changes with a message following the format: `cleanup: [area] - [specific change]`
6. Update the "Status" column to "Complete" with the date
7. Run the relevant script again to ensure the items were properly addressed

This systematic approach will help ensure that no cleanup items are missed and that we can track our progress effectively.
