## Types of Dead Code

Our analysis identified several categories of dead code in the codebase:

1. **Debug Console.log Statements**
   - Numerous `console.log` statements used for debugging
   - Should be replaced with proper logging using the LoggingService

2. **Commented-Out Code**
   - Code blocks that are commented out but kept "just in case"
   - Redundant with version control, should be removed

3. **Redundant Imports**
   - Multiple import statements from the same module
   - Can be consolidated for better readability and reduced bundle size

4. **Transitional Code**
   - Code kept during transitions (e.g., from types.ts refactoring)
   - Can now be fully migrated and the transitional code removed

5. **Unused Functions and Variables**
   - Functions and variables that are defined but never used
   - Should be identified and removed

6. **Outdated TODOs**
   - TODO comments for tasks that have been completed or abandoned
   - Should be addressed or removed

## Implementation Strategy

We will adopt a systematic approach to eliminate dead code:

1. **Audit and Document**
   - Run automated tools to identify dead code
   - Document findings for review
   - Prioritize areas with highest dead code concentration

2. **Iterative Cleanup**
   - Work module by module
   - Focus on one type of dead code at a time
   - Create automated tests where necessary
   - Verify each change with manual testing

3. **Validation**
   - Ensure functionality is preserved
   - Update documentation to reflect changes
   - Run the test suite to catch regressions

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain detailed progress notes in this document for developers
   - Keep CHANGELOG.md entries concise and focused on user-facing changes
   - Document internal implementation details here rather than in CHANGELOG

## Priority Areas

Based on initial analysis, these areas have the highest concentration of dead code:

1. **Main.ts**
   - Contains multiple console.log statements
   - Has potentially unused legacy functions

2. **Types Files**
   - Old type definitions in multiple files
   - Bridge code that should be consolidated

3. **Events and DOM Components**
   - Debug logging that should use LoggingService
   - Potentially redundant event handlers

4. **Journal Check Module**
   - Transitional code from "Linting" to "Journal Structure Check"
   - Redundant imports and unused functions

## Implementation Plan

| Class Name | Original Location | Backup Location | Removal Date | Status | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| OneiroMetricsModal | main.ts | src/dom/modals/OneiroMetricsModal.bak.ts | June 2025 | Removed | Replaced by DreamJournalManager and direct calls to scrapeMetrics |
| ConfirmModal | main.ts | src/dom/modals/ConfirmModal.bak.ts | June 2025 | Removed | Generic confirmation dialog that was defined but not actually used in the codebase |

**Progress (2025-05-29):**
- Created new branch for dead code cleanup: refactoring/2025-dead-code
- Started with removing unused imports from key files:
  - src/api/resilience/examples/ApiResilienceDemo.ts - removed ApiRequestOptions and OfflineSupport
  - src/dom/DateNavigator.ts - removed App, MarkdownView, TFile, getSourceFile, getSourceId, and isObjectSource
  - src/dom/filters/FilterUI.ts - removed safeLogger which was imported but never used
  - src/dom/DreamMetricsDOM.ts - removed DreamMetricData, getSourceId, isObjectSource, debounce, and format
- Created a utility script (utils/clean-unused-imports.ps1) to help with the cleanup process:
  - Can identify and remove unused imports from multiple files
  - Provides different output modes: summary, patch, or edit
  - Can handle both single-line and multi-line import statements
- The utility found 121 potentially unused imports across 60 files, providing a clear roadmap for additional cleanup
- Fixed an issue with the clean-unused-imports.ps1 script related to variable delimiters
- Identified unused imports in main.ts:
  - Removed attachEvent, createEventHandler, createClickHandler, debounceEventHandler, and throttleEventHandler from EventHandling imports
  - Identified createFolderAutocomplete and createSelectedNotesAutocomplete imports for potential removal after verification
  - Identified CustomDateRangeModal import for potential removal after verification
- Verified via grep search that these imports are not used directly in main.ts
- Continued removing unused imports from more files:
  - Analyzed CustomDateRangeModal.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed DreamMetricsDOM.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed ApiResilienceDemo.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed DateNavigator.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed FilterEvents.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed ProjectNoteEvents.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed MetricsProcessor.ts - No unused imports found
  - Analyzed settings.ts - No unused imports found
  - Attempted to remove unused imports from main.ts - Tool identified potential unused imports but editing was unsuccessful

#### Next Steps for Import Cleanup:
- Need to verify if the unused imports in main.ts are truly unused, as the tool reported possible unused imports but might include false positives
- Consider focusing on the remaining high-impact files identified by the analysis tool
- Use the utility script with more specific file targeting

### Phase 2: Import Cleanup

1. Consolidate multiple imports from the same module
   - Group imports alphabetically
   - Remove unused imports
   - Use appropriate import syntax (named vs default)

2. Standardize import patterns
   - Consistent order (external, internal, types)
   - Consistent syntax (destructuring vs namespace)

**Progress (2025-05-23):**
- Reorganized imports in main.ts:
  - Grouped imports by external/internal sources
  - Ordered imports by category (external libraries, types, services, UI components)
  - Used consistent destructuring pattern with alphabetical order
  - Added clear section comments for improved readability
- Created a barrel export file for journal_check/ui components
  - Simplified importing multiple components from the same module
  - Added proper JSDoc documentation
  - Used consistent export pattern
- Reduced vertical space used by imports through better organization

### Phase 3: Transitional Code Removal

#### 3.1 Extract Large Methods from DreamMetricsPlugin Class

The main.ts file remains over 5,000 lines long, with many large methods inside the DreamMetricsPlugin class that should be extracted into separate modules. This will significantly reduce the size of main.ts and improve code organization and maintainability.

2. Move the method code to the new file
3. Update imports and dependencies
4. Create a class to encapsulate related functionality
5. Update main.ts to use the new module
6. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained

#### 3.2 Extract Standalone Utility Functions

In addition to large methods, there are many standalone utility functions that should be extracted from main.ts and other files into dedicated utility modules.

| Function Name | Lines | Source File | Target Module | Status | Date | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------|--------|------|-------|
| debugTableData | ~60 | main.ts | src/utils/debugging.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-29 | Debug table data |

| formatMetricValue | ~15 | main.ts | src/utils/formatters.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-29 | Format metric value |

**Extraction Process:**
1. Identify standalone utility functions that don't depend on class instance state
2. Create appropriate utility modules based on function purpose
3. Move functions to the new modules
4. Update imports and references in all files that use these functions
5. Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained

#### 3.3 Additional main.ts Line Count Reduction

To further reduce the size and complexity of main.ts, we can extract additional components and modules. This phase focuses on isolating coherent groups of functionality into dedicated classes that follow the single responsibility principle.

| Component Name | Lines | Source Section | Target Module | Status | Date | Notes |
|----------------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|------|-------|
| FilterManager | ~430 | applyFilters (897-1329) | src/dom/filters/FilterManager.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-29 | Extracted all filter-related functionality into a dedicated class with proper structure and error handling |
| FilterDisplayManager | ~180 | updateFilterDisplay (3334-3466) | src/dom/filters/FilterDisplayManager.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-31 | Created dedicated class for filter display management with consistent styling, proper error handling, and support for various filter types including date filters and custom ranges |
| TableManager | ~340 | Combined table operations | src/dom/tables/TableManager.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-31 | Extracted table initialization, metrics collection, and summary table updating with proper error handling, performance optimizations, and support for various table formats |
| EventManager | ~220 | attachProjectNoteEventListeners (669-896) | src/events/EventManager.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Handle all event attachments in one place |
| DebugTools | ~320 | Debug functions (1880-2200) | src/debug/DebugTools.ts | âœ… Complete | 2025-05-30 | Extracted debug tools and functions into a dedicated class for better organization and to remove debug code from main.ts |
| ModalsManager | ~150 | Modal creation & management | src/dom/modals/ModalsManager.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Centralize modal creation and management |
| TableInitializer | ~140 | initializeTableRowClasses (3467-3653) | src/dom/tables/TableInitializer.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Handle table initialization |
| MetricsCollector | ~180 | collectVisibleRowMetrics (3654-3765) | src/metrics/MetricsCollector.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Collection of metrics from DOM |
| GlobalHelpers | ~120 | safeSettingsAccess, getIcon, etc. | src/utils/GlobalHelpers.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Utility functions used globally |
| WindowExtensions | ~100 | window.forceApplyDateFilter, etc. | src/dom/WindowExtensions.ts | â¬œ Not Started | - | Manage window-level extensions |

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Create a new class for each component with proper interfaces and documentation
2. Extract the functionality from main.ts to the new class
3. Add necessary imports and dependencies in the new module
4. Update main.ts to initialize and use the new component
5. Remove the original code from main.ts once tests confirm the new component works correctly
6. Update any dependent components to use the new module directly instead of through main.ts

**Benefits of Additional Extraction:**
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing of isolated components
- Reduced cognitive load when working with main.ts
- Simplified debugging of specific functionality
- Support for parallel development on different components

**Example Component Design: FilterManager**
```typescript
// src/dom/filters/FilterManager.ts
import { App, Notice } from 'obsidian';
import { ILogger } from '../../logging/LoggerTypes';
import { DreamMetricsSettings } from '../../types/core';

export class FilterManager {
    constructor(
        private app: App,
        private settings: DreamMetricsSettings,
        private saveSettings: () => Promise<void>,
        private logger?: ILogger
    ) { }
    
    public applyFilters(previewEl: HTMLElement): void {
        // Implementation extracted from main.ts
    }
    
    public applyFilterToDropdown(filterDropdown: HTMLSelectElement, previewEl: HTMLElement): boolean {
        // Implementation extracted from main.ts
    }
    
    public forceApplyFilterDirect(previewEl: HTMLElement, startDate: string, endDate: string): void {
        // Implementation extracted from main.ts
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Unused Code Elimination

1. Identify and remove unused functions
   - Run static analysis tools

  - 'MetricsNote': Updates to the metrics note
  - 'Backup': File backup operations
  - 'Settings': Settings loading/saving
  - 'UI': User interface interactions
  - 'Plugin': Core plugin lifecycle events
- Next steps:
  - Continue replacing remaining console.log statements with structured logging
  - Add log level controls to ensure debug logs only appear when appropriate
  - Remove unused code identified in previous analysis

**Summary Status (2025-05-27):**
Phase 3 (Transitional Code Removal) is complete with the migration to the consolidated type system. We've made significant progress on Phase 1 (Logging Cleanup) by replacing critical console.log statements with structured logging in main.ts and other core files. Phase 4 (Unused Code Elimination) has started with the removal of unused methods in DreamMetricsState and updating dependencies to address security issues.

The remaining tasks are:
1. Complete replacement of debug console.log statements in UI-related code
2. Remove remaining unused code identified through analysis
3. Add better log-level controls for filtering debug messages
4. Address TypeScript errors that still exist in the codebase

## Success Criteria

The dead code elimination phase will be considered successful when:

1. All `console.log` statements have been replaced with proper logging
2. Redundant imports have been consolidated
3. Transitional code has been removed
4. No unused functions remain in the codebase
5. All TODOs have been addressed or documented in ISSUES.md
6. The codebase passes all tests and functions as expected

## Next Steps

1. Continue replacing remaining console.log statements with structured logging
2. Remove remaining identified unused code
3. Fix TypeScript errors in the codebase
4. Add better log level controls for filtering debug messages
5. Extract additional components identified in Phase 3.3 to further reduce main.ts line count
6. Update documentation to reflect the changes 

**Progress (2025-05-28):**
- Consolidated and fixed type definitions to improve TypeScript compatibility:
  - Created a SelectionMode type to handle 'notes'|'folder' vs 'manual'|'automatic' compatibility 
  - Updated DreamMetricData.source to support both string and object formats
  - Fixed calloutMetadata property to include required type field
  - Added missing properties to DreamMetricsSettings interface
  - Added proper type imports across files
  - Created backwards compatibility aliases where needed
- Fixed build issues despite remaining TypeScript errors:
  - Used appropriate type assertions to handle legacy properties
  - Added helper functions to safely access potentially missing properties
  - Fixed missing dreamTitle variable in dream entry creation
  - Updated properties access to avoid type errors
  - Verified build process works correctly with node esbuild.config.mjs production

### Phase 5: TypeScript Adapter Cleanup

1. **Consolidate Helper Utilities**
   - Review helper utilities created during refactoring
   - Identify which should be permanent vs. temporary
   - Create a plan for standardizing utility usage

2. **Clean Up Temporary Code**
   - Identify code added purely for migration
   - Mark temporary compatibility layers
   - Create a schedule for removal

3. **Remove Temporary Compatibility Code**
   - Review adapter utilities
   - Check for remaining dependencies on adapter files
   - Create replacement implementations where needed
   - Remove temporary adapter code when safe

**Progress (2025-05-24):**
- Reviewed the adapter files to identify their usage patterns:
  - src/utils/adapter-functions.ts
  - src/utils/type-adapters.ts
  - src/utils/property-compatibility.ts
  - src/utils/component-migrator.ts
- Added migration notices to all adapter files pointing to typescript-architecture-lessons.md
- Created a phased approach for adapter removal (documented in typescript-architecture-lessons.md)
- Consolidated remaining TypeScript-related documentation:
  - Moved implementation recommendations from post-refactoring-documentation-plan.md to code-cleanup-plan.md
  - Ensured all key information is preserved in active documentation

**Next Steps (Phase 5):**
- Create dependency audit of all adapter file usage
- Create classification table (keep, refactor, remove) for adapter functionality
- Implement permanent replacements for essential adapter functionality
- Update imports one file at a time, starting with non-critical components
- Remove adapter files once all dependencies have been updated 

**Progress (2025-05-25):**
- Refactored date handling functions in main.ts to use centralized utilities
  - Replaced local validateDate, parseDate, and formatDate implementations with imports from src/utils/date-utils.ts
  - Updated method references across the file to use the shared utilities
  - Added proper null handling for parseDate return values
  - Maintained compatibility with existing code through wrapper methods
  - Added import statement for date utilities
  - Verified functionality with testing
- Identified potential areas for further date handling improvements:
  - Add consistent error handling for date parsing failures
  - Standardize date format strings across the codebase
  - Create more robust date range handling utilities

#### Console.log Statistics

- Total files with console statements: 28 (down from 33)
- Total console statements: 83 (down from 114)
- By type: console.log (44), console.warn (4), console.error (31), console.info (2), console.debug (2)
- Completed: 
  - 19 statements in main.ts
  - 8 statements in settings.ts
  - 6 statements in src/testing/TestRunner.ts
  - 14 statements in src/testing/EdgeCaseTests.ts
  - 6 statements in src/testing/utils/TypeGuardsTests.ts
  - 3 statements in src/dom/DateNavigator.ts (with linter errors to fix)

#### Notable Console.log Files (Remaining):
- src/logging/adapters/ConsoleAdapter.ts: 7 statements (intentional)
- src/logging/safe-logger.ts: 7 statements (intentional)
- src/testing/JournalCheckTests.ts: 4 statements
- src/journal_check/JournalCheckEngine.ts: 2 statements
- main.ts: 2 statements (remaining)

*Note: For the complete list, run `.\utils\find-console-logs.ps1`*

### Progress Update (2025-05-28)

The console.log cleanup effort has made significant progress:
- Cleaned up 31 console statements across 4 key files
- Reduced total console statements from 114 to 83 (27% reduction)
- Completed cleanup in all major testing files
- Created a comprehensive status document at `docs/developer/implementation/console-log-cleanup-status.md`

### Progress Update (2025-05-30)

Completed extraction of debugging tools into a dedicated DebugTools class. This refactoring removed ~500 lines of debug code from main.ts by consolidating three large debugging methods (debugTableData, debugDateNavigator, testContentParserDirectly) into a well-structured class with proper error handling.

Next steps in the cleanup effort:
1. Fix linter errors in DateNavigator.ts (high priority)
2. Clean up remaining non-logging-system console statements
3. Add documentation to console statements that are intentional parts of the logging system
4. Update logger configuration to properly filter log levels in production builds

### Commented Code Blocks

We found primarily documentation comments related to TypeScript interfaces rather than commented-out code blocks. The commented-code analysis should be run again with adjusted parameters to better identify actual code blocks.

| File | Lines | Type | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| src/journal_check/types.ts | 1-4 | Multi-line | Pending | Deprecation notice for types file |
| src/types.ts | 1-4 | Multi-line | Pending | Deprecation notice for types file |
| main.ts | 3820-3824 | Multi-line | Pending | Debug function accessible from console |

#### Commented Code Statistics

- Most comments are properly formatted TypeScript documentation (JSDoc style)
- 3 deprecation notices for files being phased out
- Several commented-out code snippets that appear to be examples rather than dead code

*Note: Run `.\utils\find-commented-code.ps1` for the complete list*

### Outdated TODOs

No TODOs were found in the codebase during our scan. This suggests that the team has been diligent about addressing TODOs as part of the refactoring process.

*Note: Run `.\utils\find-outdated-todos.ps1` to verify*

### Unused Imports

| File | Import | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| src/dom/filters/FilterUI.ts | TFile | Completed | Removed unused TFile import while keeping safeLogger |
| main.ts | FileView, Menu, Scope, WorkspaceLeaf, ButtonComponent | Completed | Already removed in newer version |
| main.ts | registerSettings | Completed | Already removed in newer version |
| main.ts | FilterUI | Completed | Already removed in newer version |
| main.ts | Multiple date-fns imports | Completed | Already updated in newer version |

#### Unused Imports Statistics

- Total files with unused imports: 60
- Total potentially unused imports: 116
- 9 instances of unused safeLogger import across different files
- 7 instances of unused App from 'obsidian'
- 5 instances of unused TFile from 'obsidian'

#### Notable Files with Unused Imports:
- main.ts: 8 unused imports
- src/dom/DreamMetricsDOM.ts: 5 unused imports
- src/journal_check/ui/DreamJournalManager.ts: 5 unused imports
- src/dom/date-navigator/DateNavigator.ts: 4 unused imports
- src/metrics/MetricsProcessor.ts: 4 unused imports

*Note: For the complete list, run `.\utils\find-unused-imports.ps1`*

### Progress Update (2025-05-29)

Started work on the unused imports cleanup:
- Created new branch `refactoring/2025-dead-code` for dead code cleanup
- Started cleaning up unused imports in key files:
  - src/api/resilience/examples/ApiResilienceDemo.ts - removed ApiRequestOptions and OfflineSupport
  - src/dom/DateNavigator.ts - removed App, MarkdownView, TFile, getSourceFile, getSourceId, and isObjectSource
  - src/dom/filters/FilterUI.ts - removed safeLogger which was imported but never used
  - src/dom/DreamMetricsDOM.ts - removed DreamMetricData, getSourceId, isObjectSource, debounce, and format
- Created utility script `utils/clean-unused-imports.ps1` to help identify and remove unused imports
- Identified 121 potentially unused imports across 60 files that need further cleanup

Next steps for imports cleanup:
- Continue removing unused imports from more files
- Focus on high-impact files like main.ts that have multiple unused imports
- Use the utility script to process multiple files efficiently

## Cleanup Process

To update the status of items in these tracking tables:

1. Identify a batch of related items to clean up (e.g., console.log statements in a specific file)
2. Update the "Status" column to "In Progress"
3. Make the necessary code changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit changes with a message following the format: `cleanup: [area] - [specific change]`
6. Update the "Status" column to "Complete" with the date
7. Run the relevant script again to ensure the items were properly addressed

This systematic approach will help ensure that no cleanup items are missed and that we can track our progress effectively. 

## Cleanup Progress

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the OneiroMetrics plugin codebase.

### 1. Main.ts Line Count Reduction

The main.ts file has grown to over 5,000 lines, making it difficult to maintain. This phase focuses on extracting functionality into separate modules.

### Initial Size

- main.ts: ~5,100 lines

### Component Extraction Plan
