## Overview

With the major architectural refactoring complete, OneiroMetrics now has a modular, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns. This roadmap details the next steps to further improve the plugin in terms of performance, user experience, and developer satisfaction.

The post-refactoring improvements are organized into four sequential phases, each building upon the previous one. These improvements aim to leverage the new architecture while addressing remaining technical debt and enhancing user experience.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Adapter Migration

**Goal:** Ensure consistency, quality, and modularity across the codebase following the major refactoring.

### Tasks:

1. **Naming Standardization**
   - [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions across all modules
   - [ ] Rename any remaining ambiguous variables and functions
   - [ ] Update file names to better reflect their contents

2. **Code Style Consistency**
   - [ ] Apply consistent indentation and formatting
   - [ ] Standardize comment style and documentation
   - [ ] Run linting tools across the entire codebase

3. **Dead Code Elimination**
   - [ ] Remove commented-out code sections
   - [ ] Delete unused functions and variables
   - [ ] Clean up redundant imports

4. **Type Definition Refinement**
   - [ ] Strengthen type definitions
   - [ ] Eliminate any remaining `any` types
   - [ ] Add explicit return types to all functions

5. **TypeScript Error Resolution**
   - [x] Fix approximately 150+ TypeScript errors across the codebase
   - [x] Address interface definition inconsistencies (see archived docs in `docs/archive/refactoring-2025/`)
   - [x] Resolve type compatibility issues with SelectionMode and LogLevel
   - [x] Fix missing or incorrectly referenced properties in interfaces
   - [x] Install missing dependencies
   - [x] Address object property access issues
   - [x] Follow standardized interface patterns in [typescript-interface-standards.md](./typescript-interface-standards.md)

6. **Dependency Audit and Adapter Migration**
   - [ ] Identify all places using adapter files (adapter-functions.ts, type-adapters.ts, etc.)
   - [ ] Map legacy functions in main.ts to their module counterparts
   - [ ] Classify adapter functions with a keep/refactor/remove strategy
   - [ ] Document dependencies between components for safe migration

7. **Main.ts Cleanup**
   - [ ] Identify deprecated code in main.ts that duplicates module functionality
   - [ ] Replace direct usage of legacy functions with module counterparts
   - [ ] Remove unnecessary code superseded by the modular architecture
   - [ ] Ensure proper initialization and integration with modules

8. **Adapter Migration Implementation**
   - [ ] Implement permanent replacements for essential adapter functionality
   - [ ] Update imports one file at a time, starting with non-critical components
   - [ ] Verify functionality after each migration step
   - [ ] Remove temporary adapter code once dependencies are updated

### Current Progress:

| metric-helpers.ts | multiple files | isMetricEnabled, getMetricRange, standardizeMetric | âœ… Permanent | Low |

## Comprehensive Testing Initiative

**Goal:** Verify the integrity and functionality of the refactored codebase through systematic testing of all components and user-facing features.

### Testing Priorities:

1. **Settings System Testing**
   - Verify settings persistence and retrieval
   - Test settings migration between versions
   - Validate settings adaptation via adaptSettingsToCore
   - Test default values application
   - Verify UI interactions with settings components
   - Test all settings helper functions

2. **Systematic Functional Testing**
   - Create a comprehensive test matrix of all user features
   - Test each feature systematically in actual Obsidian environments
   - Verify all UI components render correctly
   - Test all user interaction flows from start to finish

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with large journals (1000+ entries)
   - Test with various date formats and range selections
   - Verify behavior with malformed or incomplete journal entries
   - Test functionality with missing or corrupted settings

4. **Cross-Environment Verification**
   - Test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Test with different Obsidian versions (current stable, previous, insider builds)
   - Validate functionality with various plugin configurations
   - Test with different vault sizes and structures

### Testing Approach:

### Testing Documentation:

Each test should be documented with:
- Specific test steps to reproduce
- Expected outcome
- Actual outcome
- Environment details
- Version information

**Comprehensive test documentation is maintained in the [Testing Documentation Index](./testing/index.md), which contains links to detailed test plans for each component and feature area.**

### Merge Criteria:

**The criteria for merging the `refactoring/2025-typescript` branch back to the `main` branch has moved from a time-based approach to a test-completion-based approach.** The detailed merge criteria, including core test requirements and approval process, are documented in [Testing Documentation - Merge Criteria](./testing/index.md#merge-criteria).

> **Note:** The `refactoring/2025-typescript` branch is the current active development branch for the TypeScript refactoring effort, superseding the earlier `refactoring/2025` branch. All testing and merge criteria apply specifically to the `refactoring/2025-typescript` branch.

### Testing Timeline:

- Settings System Tests: 1 week
- Core Functionality Tests: 2 weeks
- Extended Feature Tests: 1 week
- Cross-Environment Tests: 1 week
- Bug fixing and verification: 1 week

### Success Criteria:

- All critical and high-priority tests passed
- No critical bugs remaining in core functionality
- Settings system fully verified across platforms
- All user workflows validated end-to-end
- Thorough documentation of test results

### Integration with Existing Work:

This testing initiative complements the TypeScript error resolution work by ensuring that the syntactic correctness of the code (addressed by TypeScript) is matched by functional correctness (addressed by this testing). The testing will also generate real-world examples that can be used in the documentation enhancement phase.

Detailed test plans have been created for key components:
- [Settings Component Test Plan](./testing/settings-test-plan.md) - Comprehensive testing of the settings system
- [Dream Journal Management Test Plan](./testing/journal-management-test-plan.md) - End-to-end testing of journal functionality

Additional test plans will be created for other components following the same structure and approach.
