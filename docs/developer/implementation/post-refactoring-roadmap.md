# Post-Refactoring Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the development roadmap following the refactoring rollback in 2025. It provides a structured approach to implementing the architectural improvements while avoiding the issues encountered in the previous refactoring attempt. For a detailed analysis of what went wrong during the previous refactoring attempt, see the [Refactoring Lessons Learned](./refactoring-lessons-learned.md) document.

   - Create maintenance guide

## Prioritized Task List

| Task | Priority | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Create Safe Logger Implementation | High | 2 days | None |
| Map Global Dependencies | High | 3 days | None |
| Fix Critical UI Bugs | High | 2 days | None |
| Create Service Registry | Medium | 4 days | Dependency Mapping |
| Define Module Interfaces | Medium | 5 days | Dependency Mapping |
| Implement Event Manager | Medium | 6 days | Service Registry |
| Fix Content Parsing Issues | Medium | 4 days | None |
| Improve UI Components | Medium | 5 days | Event Manager |
| Update Documentation | Low | 3 days | All Above |

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be tracked against these key metrics:

1. **Error Reduction**: Zero initialization errors on startup
2. **Functionality**: All features working as expected
3. **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability scores
4. **Test Coverage**: >80% test coverage on critical paths
5. **Performance**: No performance regression from baseline

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these improvements, refer to the [Refactoring Lessons Learned](./refactoring-lessons-learned.md) document for detailed patterns and approaches to avoid previous pitfalls.

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: One component at a time
2. **Defensive Coding**: Assume dependencies might be missing
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Explicit APIs between components
4. **Proper Testing**: Test initialization and error cases
5. **Documentation**: Document dependencies and requirements

## Timeline

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Status | Key Milestones |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Stabilization | 2025-05-26 | 2025-06-15 | üîÑ In Progress (60%) | ‚úÖ Documentation Complete, üîÑ Critical Bugs Being Fixed |
| Incremental Improvements | 2025-06-16 | 2025-07-15 | ‚è≥ Planned | Safe Utilities Complete, Interfaces Defined |
| Component Refactoring | 2025-07-16 | 2025-08-30 | ‚è≥ Planned | Logger Refactored, Event System Improved |

## Progress Overview

![Progress Bar](https://progress-bar.dev/25/ "Refactoring Progress")

Current progress is primarily in the documentation and planning phase, with approximately 25% of the overall refactoring plan completed. Key accomplishments:

- ‚úÖ Successfully identified and documented all issues from the failed refactoring
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation of lessons learned
- ‚úÖ Established a clear roadmap with prioritized tasks
- ‚úÖ Removed orphaned files and fixed immediate issues
- üîÑ Working on remaining UI bugs and preparing test environment

Next major milestone: Complete all stabilization tasks by 2025-06-15.

## Conclusion

Following this roadmap will allow us to implement the architectural improvements while maintaining plugin functionality and avoiding the initialization issues encountered in the previous refactoring attempt. By focusing on defensive coding, clear interfaces, and proper testing, we can achieve a more maintainable codebase.
