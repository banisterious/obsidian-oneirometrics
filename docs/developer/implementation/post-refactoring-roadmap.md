## Success Metrics

The implementation will be tracked against these key metrics:

1. **Error Reduction**: Zero initialization errors on startup
2. **Functionality**: All features working as expected
3. **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability scores
4. **Test Coverage**: >80% test coverage on critical paths
5. **Performance**: No performance regression from baseline

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these improvements, refer to the [Refactoring Lessons Learned](./refactoring-lessons-learned.md) document for detailed patterns and approaches to avoid previous pitfalls.

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: One component at a time
2. **Defensive Coding**: Assume dependencies might be missing
3. **Clear Interfaces**: Explicit APIs between components
4. **Proper Testing**: Test initialization and error cases
5. **Documentation**: Document dependencies and requirements

## Conclusion

Following this roadmap will allow us to implement the architectural improvements while maintaining plugin functionality and avoiding the initialization issues encountered in the previous refactoring attempt. By focusing on defensive coding, clear interfaces, and proper testing, we can achieve a more maintainable codebase.
