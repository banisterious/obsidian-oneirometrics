## Overview

With the major architectural refactoring complete, OneiroMetrics now has a modular, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns. This roadmap details the next steps to further improve the plugin in terms of performance, user experience, and developer satisfaction.

The post-refactoring improvements are organized into four sequential phases, each building upon the previous one. These improvements aim to leverage the new architecture while addressing remaining technical debt and enhancing user experience.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanup

**Goal:** Ensure consistency and quality across the codebase following the major refactoring.

### Tasks:

1. **Naming Standardization**
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across all modules
   - Rename any remaining ambiguous variables and functions
   - Update file names to better reflect their contents

2. **Code Style Consistency**
   - Apply consistent indentation and formatting
   - Standardize comment style and documentation
   - Run linting tools across the entire codebase

3. **Dead Code Elimination**
   - Remove commented-out code sections
   - Delete unused functions and variables
   - Clean up redundant imports

4. **Type Definition Refinement**
   - Strengthen type definitions
   - Eliminate any remaining `any` types
   - Add explicit return types to all functions

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Enhance the overall performance and responsiveness of the plugin.

### Tasks:

1. **CSS Optimization**
   - Optimize CSS selectors for performance
   - Reduce specificity conflicts
   - Minimize redundant styles
   - Improve animation performance

2. **Data Processing Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets

   - Reduce unnecessary DOM manipulations
   - Optimize component rendering cycles
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Improve modal rendering performance

4. **File Operation Optimization**
   - Batch file operations when possible
   - Implement more efficient file reading strategies
   - Add progressive loading for large files
   - Optimize search and filtering operations

5. **UI-Specific Optimizations**
   - Calendar preview optimization
   - Time filter state management improvements
   - Date range selector performance enhancements
   - Metrics visualization efficiency improvements

## Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive, accessible documentation for users and developers.

### Tasks:

1. **User Documentation**
   - Create step-by-step tutorials for common workflows
   - Develop visual guides with annotated screenshots
   - Write clear explanations of all features and options
   - Create video tutorials for complex features

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Document architecture with updated diagrams
   - Provide contributing guidelines
   - Create API documentation
   - Add code examples for plugin extension

3. **Visual Documentation**
   - Create and update architecture diagrams
   - Add workflow diagrams for complex processes
   - Design user flow diagrams
   - Create component hierarchy visualizations

4. **Documentation Integration**
   - Implement in-app help system
   - Add contextual documentation
   - Create a searchable documentation portal
   - Link external resources and community content

## Phase 4: Advanced Optimization

**Goal:** Implement cutting-edge improvements that leverage the new architecture.

### Tasks:

1. **Advanced State Management**
   - Implement reactive state management
   - Add state persistence improvements
   - Create better state debugging tools
   - Optimize state update propagation

2. **Testing Infrastructure Enhancement**

   - Add automated UI testing
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Create performance benchmark tests

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Enhance screen reader support
   - Add high contrast mode support

4. **Mobile Experience Optimization**
   - Refine touch interactions
   - Optimize for small screens
   - Improve performance on mobile devices
   - Create mobile-specific UI adaptations

5. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Improve Templater integration
   - Add Dataview compatibility
   - Enhance Calendar plugin integration
   - Create API for third-party plugin integration

## Post-Refactoring Management TODOs

**Goal:** Enhance the management of the post-refactoring phase and prepare for successful branch merging.

### Priority Tasks (Next 1-2 Days):

- [ ] **Test Tracking Dashboard**
  - Create a visual dashboard (markdown file or Obsidian canvas) to track test completion
  - Include progress bars or checklists for each test category
  - Link to the relevant test plan documents
  - Update daily during the testing phase

- [ ] **Branch Protection Rules**
  - Set up protection rules for the main branch
  - Require reviews before merging the refactoring branch
  - Enforce test completion requirements via GitHub branch rules

- [ ] **Automated Testing Setup**
  - Implement initial automated tests for core components
  - Focus on the four merge criteria areas: Settings, Scraping, Tables, Filters
  - Create simple assertion-based tests for critical functions
  - Document test setup for contributors

- [ ] **User Communication Plan**
  - Draft announcement for the upcoming merged changes
  - Prepare release notes for the first post-refactoring release
  - Create a user-friendly explanation of the improvements
  - Plan communication channels and timing

### Additional Tasks:

- [ ] **Documentation Review**
  - Schedule a final documentation review before merging
  - Ensure consistency across all documents
  - Check for outdated references or examples
  - Verify technical accuracy of all documentation

- [ ] **Refactoring Retrospective**
  - Plan a retrospective session to document lessons learned
  - Create a template for capturing feedback
  - Document what went well and areas for improvement
