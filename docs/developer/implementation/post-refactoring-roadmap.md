## Overview

With the major architectural refactoring complete, OneiroMetrics now has a modular, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns. This roadmap details the next steps to further improve the plugin in terms of performance, user experience, and developer satisfaction.

The post-refactoring improvements are organized into four sequential phases, each building upon the previous one. These improvements aim to leverage the new architecture while addressing remaining technical debt and enhancing user experience.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanup

**Goal:** Ensure consistency and quality across the codebase following the major refactoring.

### Tasks:

1. **Naming Standardization**
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across all modules
   - Rename any remaining ambiguous variables and functions
   - Update file names to better reflect their contents

2. **Code Style Consistency**
   - Apply consistent indentation and formatting
   - Standardize comment style and documentation
   - Run linting tools across the entire codebase

3. **Dead Code Elimination**
   - Remove commented-out code sections
   - Delete unused functions and variables
   - Clean up redundant imports

4. **Type Definition Refinement**
   - Strengthen type definitions
   - Eliminate any remaining `any` types
   - Add explicit return types to all functions

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Enhance the overall performance and responsiveness of the plugin.

### Tasks:

1. **CSS Optimization**
   - Optimize CSS selectors for performance
   - Reduce specificity conflicts
   - Minimize redundant styles
   - Improve animation performance

2. **Data Processing Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize validation engine for faster processing
   - Refine data structures for better memory usage

3. **UI Rendering Improvements**
   - Reduce unnecessary DOM manipulations
   - Optimize component rendering cycles
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Improve modal rendering performance

4. **File Operation Optimization**
   - Batch file operations when possible
   - Implement more efficient file reading strategies
   - Add progressive loading for large files
   - Optimize search and filtering operations

5. **UI-Specific Optimizations**
   - Calendar preview optimization
   - Time filter state management improvements
   - Date range selector performance enhancements
   - Metrics visualization efficiency improvements

## Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive, accessible documentation for users and developers.

### Tasks:

1. **User Documentation**
   - Create step-by-step tutorials for common workflows
   - Develop visual guides with annotated screenshots
   - Write clear explanations of all features and options
   - Create video tutorials for complex features

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Document architecture with updated diagrams
   - Provide contributing guidelines
   - Create API documentation
   - Add code examples for plugin extension

3. **Visual Documentation**
   - Create and update architecture diagrams
   - Add workflow diagrams for complex processes
   - Design user flow diagrams
   - Create component hierarchy visualizations

4. **Documentation Integration**
   - Implement in-app help system
   - Add contextual documentation
   - Create a searchable documentation portal
   - Link external resources and community content

## Phase 4: Advanced Optimization

**Goal:** Implement cutting-edge improvements that leverage the new architecture.

### Tasks:

1. **Advanced State Management**
   - Implement reactive state management
   - Add state persistence improvements
   - Create better state debugging tools
   - Optimize state update propagation

2. **Testing Infrastructure Enhancement**
   - Expand unit test coverage to 90%+
   - Add automated UI testing
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Create performance benchmark tests

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Enhance screen reader support
   - Add high contrast mode support

4. **Mobile Experience Optimization**
   - Refine touch interactions
   - Optimize for small screens
   - Improve performance on mobile devices
   - Create mobile-specific UI adaptations

5. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Improve Templater integration
   - Add Dataview compatibility
   - Enhance Calendar plugin integration
   - Create API for third-party plugin integration

## Timeline and Priorities

The implementation timeline is structured to deliver meaningful improvements at regular intervals:

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Priority | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| Code Cleanup | 2 weeks | High | None |
| Performance Optimization | 4 weeks | High | Code Cleanup |
| Documentation Enhancement | 3 weeks | Medium | Code Cleanup |
| Advanced Optimization | 6 weeks | Medium | Performance Optimization |

**Key Milestones:**
- Code cleanup completion: +2 weeks
- Performance optimization release: +6 weeks
- Documentation portal launch: +9 weeks
- Advanced features release: +15 weeks

## Success Metrics

The success of these improvements will be measured through:

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Startup time: 50% reduction
   - UI rendering time: 40% improvement
   - Memory usage: 30% reduction
   - File processing speed: 60% improvement

2. **User Satisfaction**
