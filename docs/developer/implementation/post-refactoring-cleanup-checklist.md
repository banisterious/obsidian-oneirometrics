# Post-Refactoring Cleanup Checklist

This checklist outlines the specific tasks to complete once the TypeScript migration and refactoring effort is fully behind us. Use this document to track progress and ensure no cleanup task is missed.

## When to Perform Cleanup

Execute this cleanup **only after**:
1. The refactored codebase has been in production for at least 2-3 releases
2. No major issues have been reported related to the refactoring
3. The team has verified all components are working correctly
4. All TypeScript errors have been fully resolved

## Documentation Archiving

- [ ] Create `docs/archive/legacy` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Archive the following documents:
  - [ ] `TypeScript-Migration-Plan.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues-next-steps.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-migration-status.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-component-migration.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/examples/component-migration-example.ts`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-roadmap.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/refactoring-plan-2025.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-cleanup-checklist.md` (this file)
- [ ] Update any links or references to these documents in other documentation

> **Note:** You can use the provided `docs/developer/implementation/archive-refactoring-docs.sh` script to automate this process. Run it from the project root with `bash docs/developer/implementation/archive-refactoring-docs.sh`

## Code Cleanup

- [ ] Remove temporary adapter functions:
  - [ ] `src/utils/adapter-functions.ts`
  - [ ] `src/utils/type-adapters.ts` (created during TypeScript error resolution)
  - [ ] Check for any other adapter-specific code

- [ ] Clean up compatibility layers:
  - [ ] `src/utils/property-compatibility.ts`
  - [ ] Any legacy property access helpers

- [ ] Remove migration utilities:
  - [ ] `src/utils/component-migrator.ts`
  - [ ] Any component wrapper functions

- [ ] Clean up deprecated APIs:
  - [ ] Review codebase for `@deprecated` annotations
  - [ ] Check dependency usage before removing
  - [ ] Remove deprecated methods after verifying nothing depends on them

- [ ] Remove temporary type interfaces:
  - [ ] Legacy interfaces that were created just for migration
  - [ ] Temporary type casting functions

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run full TypeScript compilation with strict checks
- [ ] Verify zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run the complete test suite
- [ ] Manually test critical plugin functionality
- [ ] Verify proper functioning in both light and dark themes
- [ ] Check performance metrics match or exceed pre-refactoring baselines

## Release Notes

- [ ] Create release notes entry documenting the cleanup
- [ ] Note that the codebase is now fully migrated to TypeScript
- [ ] Include information about deleted compatibility/adapter code
- [ ] Thank contributors who helped with the migration effort

## Cleanup Tracking

## Notes for Future Reference

After completing the cleanup, document any lessons learned from the TypeScript migration and refactoring process. This will be valuable for future major refactoring efforts.
