# Post-Refactoring Cleanup Checklist

This checklist outlines the specific tasks to complete once the TypeScript migration and refactoring effort is fully behind us. Use this document to track progress and ensure no cleanup task is missed.

## When to Perform Cleanup

Execute this cleanup **only after**:
1. The refactored codebase has been in production for at least 2-3 releases
2. No major issues have been reported related to the refactoring
3. The team has verified all components are working correctly
4. All TypeScript errors have been fully resolved

## Documentation Archiving

- [x] Create `docs/archive/legacy` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Archive the following documents:
  - [x] `TypeScript-Migration-Plan.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues-next-steps.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-migration-status.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-component-migration.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/examples/component-migration-example.ts`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-roadmap.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/refactoring-plan-2025.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-cleanup-checklist.md` (this file)
- [x] Update any links or references to these documents in other documentation

> - PowerShell: `.\docs\developer\implementation\refactoring-cleanup.ps1`

## Code Cleanup

### Adapter Migration Plan

Rather than immediately removing temporary adapter functions, we need a phased approach to ensure ongoing compatibility. The adapter files are still being used in parts of the codebase.

#### 1. Dependency Audit
- [ ] Identify all files that import adapter utilities:
  - [ ] Map which specific functions/classes are used from each adapter
  - [ ] Classify dependencies as critical path or peripheral
  - [ ] Document each usage with code examples

#### 2. Functionality Assessment
- [ ] Determine which adapter functionality should become permanent:
  - [ ] Create classification table (keep, refactor, remove)
  - [ ] For "keep" items, document reasons and implementation approach
  - [ ] For "refactor" items, design new interfaces and implementations
  - [ ] For "remove" items, verify they aren't needed

#### 3. Phased Migration
- [ ] Phase 1: Create permanent replacements for essential adapter functionality
  - [ ] Implement permanent replacements in appropriate locations
  - [ ] Document the new implementations thoroughly
  - [ ] Add tests for the new implementations

- [ ] Phase 2: Update imports one file at a time
  - [ ] Start with non-critical components first
  - [ ] Test thoroughly after each file update
  - [ ] Address any TypeScript errors that arise

- [x] Phase 3: Create adapter stubs if needed
  - [x] Add migration notices to adapter files (completed by cleanup script)
  - [ ] Create stub files that re-export from new locations
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility until all imports are updated

- [ ] Phase 4: Final removal
  - [ ] Only after all imports are updated, remove original adapter files:
    - [ ] `src/utils/adapter-functions.ts`
    - [ ] `src/utils/type-adapters.ts`
    - [ ] `src/utils/property-compatibility.ts`
    - [ ] `src/utils/component-migrator.ts`

### Additional Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] Clean up deprecated APIs:
  - [ ] Review codebase for `@deprecated` annotations
  - [ ] Check dependency usage before removing
  - [ ] Remove deprecated methods after verifying nothing depends on them

- [ ] Remove temporary type interfaces:
  - [ ] Legacy interfaces that were created just for migration
  - [ ] Temporary type casting functions

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run full TypeScript compilation with strict checks
- [ ] Verify zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run the complete test suite
- [ ] Manually test critical plugin functionality
- [ ] Verify proper functioning in both light and dark themes
- [ ] Check performance metrics match or exceed pre-refactoring baselines

## Release Notes

- [ ] Create release notes entry documenting the cleanup
- [ ] Note that the codebase is now fully migrated to TypeScript
- [ ] Include information about deleted compatibility/adapter code
- [ ] Thank contributors who helped with the migration effort

## Cleanup Tracking

## Notes for Future Reference

After completing the cleanup, document any lessons learned from the TypeScript migration and refactoring process. This will be valuable for future major refactoring efforts.
