# Archived Date Component Planning Documents

**Archive Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Reason**: Consolidated into unified planning document

## 📁 **Archived Documents**

The following planning documents have been archived and replaced by a unified document:

### **Original Documents**
- **`date-navigator.md`** - Date Navigator implementation plan (76% complete)
- **`date-tools.md`** - Date Tools feature planning (52% complete)  
- **`month-view.md`** - Month View implementation plan (80% complete)

### **Consolidation Rationale**

These three documents contained significant overlap and duplication:
- **Date Navigator** and **Month View** were essentially the same feature (both implemented via `DateNavigator` component)
- **Date Tools** encompassed broader functionality including both navigation and advanced features
- All three referenced similar core components, CSS classes, and technical implementations
- Implementation phases were overlapping across documents
- Different completion percentages for the same underlying features created confusion

## 🔗 **New Unified Document**

**Location**: `docs/archive/planning/features/2025-completed/date-calendar-unified.md`

**Benefits of Unification**:
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Single source of truth for date-related features
- **Clearer Roadmap**: Organized by implementation status rather than artificial feature boundaries
- **Accurate Status**: 69% overall completion with clear breakdown of what's done vs. planned
- **Better Organization**: Features grouped by completion status (Complete, Partial, Planned)
- **Technical Accuracy**: Component names and implementations match actual codebase

## 📊 **Status Translation**

| **Original Document** | **Status** | **Unified Section** |
|----------------------|------------|-------------------|
