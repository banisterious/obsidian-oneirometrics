## Completion Criteria

This cleanup phase will be considered complete when:

1. All orphaned files are removed or properly integrated
2. Critical functionality is verified working
3. Known issues are documented
4. Temporary fixes are in place for critical issues
5. Documentation is updated to reflect current state
6. A plan is in place for the next steps

## Notes

The primary goal of this cleanup is to stabilize the current codebase while preparing for a more structured refactoring approach as outlined in the [Refactoring Lessons Learned](../../developer/implementation/refactoring-lessons-learned.md) document.

## When to Perform Cleanup

Execute this cleanup **only after**:
1. The refactored codebase has been in production for at least 2-3 releases
2. No major issues have been reported related to the refactoring
3. The team has verified all components are working correctly
4. All TypeScript errors have been fully resolved

## Documentation Archiving

- [x] Create `docs/archive/legacy` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Archive the following documents:
  - [x] `TypeScript-Migration-Plan.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-issues-next-steps.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-migration-status.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/typescript-component-migration.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/examples/component-migration-example.ts`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-roadmap.md`
  - [x] `docs/developer/implementation/refactoring-plan-2025.md`
  - [ ] `docs/developer/implementation/post-refactoring-cleanup-checklist.md` (this file)
- [x] Update any links or references to these documents in other documentation

## Code Cleanup

### Adapter Migration Plan âœ…

The adapter migration plan has been fully implemented as of May 26, 2025. All adapter modules have been replaced with permanent implementations, and legacy adapter files now redirect to their permanent replacements with proper deprecation notices.

#### 1. Dependency Audit âœ…
- [x] Identify all files that import adapter utilities:
  - [x] Map which specific functions/classes are used from each adapter
  - [x] Classify dependencies as critical path or peripheral
  - [x] Document each usage with code examples

#### 2. Functionality Assessment âœ…
- [x] Determine which adapter functionality should become permanent:
  - [x] Create classification table (keep, refactor, remove)
  - [x] For "keep" items, document reasons and implementation approach
  - [x] For "refactor" items, design new interfaces and implementations
  - [x] For "remove" items, verify they aren't needed

#### 3. Phased Migration âœ…
- [x] Phase 1: Create permanent replacements for essential adapter functionality
  - [x] Implement permanent replacements in appropriate locations
  - [x] Document the new implementations thoroughly
  - [x] Add tests for the new implementations

- [x] Phase 2: Update imports one file at a time
  - [x] Start with non-critical components first
  - [x] Test thoroughly after each file update
  - [x] Address any TypeScript errors that arise

- [x] Phase 3: Create adapter stubs if needed
  - [x] Add migration notices to adapter files (completed by cleanup script)
  - [x] Create stub files that re-export from new locations
  - [x] Maintain backward compatibility until all imports are updated

- [x] Phase 4: Final removal
  - [x] Create stub files that redirect to permanent implementations instead of removing the originals:
    - [x] `src/utils/adapter-functions.ts` â†’ Redirects to ContentParser, MetricComponent, etc.
    - [x] `src/utils/type-adapters.ts` â†’ Redirects to settings-helpers and SettingsAdapter
    - [x] `src/utils/property-compatibility.ts` â†’ Redirects to property-helpers and CalloutParser
    - [x] `src/utils/component-migrator.ts` â†’ Redirects to ComponentFactory and FilterFactory

### Logging System Refactoring ðŸ”„

The logging system refactoring is nearly complete as of June 3, 2025. We've made significant progress in replacing console.log statements with structured logging using the LoggingService throughout the codebase.

#### 1. Core Plugin Logging âœ…
- [x] Replace console.log statements in plugin lifecycle methods (onload, onunload)
- [x] Update initialization and cleanup logging
- [x] Add structured logging for plugin events

#### 2. Feature-Specific Logging ðŸ”„
- [x] Update metrics calculation and processing logs
- [x] Refactor UI interaction and event handling logs
- [x] Modernize filter and date navigation logs
- [x] Update debug and test function logging
- [ ] Complete remaining logging in utility functions

#### 3. Standardization âœ…
- [x] Implement consistent log categories (Plugin, UI, Filter, Table, Metrics, MetricsNote, Debug)
- [x] Standardize log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- [x] Add structured data parameters for better context
- [x] Improve error handling with proper Error objects

#### 4. Configuration ðŸ”„
- [x] Implement global logger for non-class contexts
- [ ] Add log level controls in settings
- [ ] Add log rotation configuration
- [ ] Implement log file size management

### Additional Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] Clean up deprecated APIs:
  - [ ] Review codebase for `@deprecated` annotations
  - [ ] Check dependency usage before removing
  - [ ] Remove deprecated methods after verifying nothing depends on them

- [ ] Remove temporary type interfaces:
  - [ ] Legacy interfaces that were created just for migration
  - [ ] Temporary type casting functions

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run full TypeScript compilation with strict checks
- [ ] Verify zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run the complete test suite
- [ ] Manually test critical plugin functionality
- [ ] Verify proper functioning in both light and dark themes
- [ ] Check performance metrics match or exceed pre-refactoring baselines

## Release Notes

- [ ] Create release notes entry documenting the cleanup
- [ ] Note that the codebase is now fully migrated to TypeScript
- [ ] Include information about deleted compatibility/adapter code
- [ ] Thank contributors who helped with the migration effort
