# Custom Range Button Removal and Modal Archival

## Summary

Successfully removed the redundant "Custom Range" button and archived the old `CustomDateRangeModal` as part of the OneiroMetrics UI consolidation. The functionality has been replaced by the more comprehensive `DateSelectionModal` accessible via the "Date Navigator" button.

## Changes Made

### 1. Button Removal from UI Generation
- **File**: `src/dom/tables/TableGenerator.ts` (line 67)
- **Change**: Removed the HTML generation for `oom-custom-range-btn`
- **Impact**: Custom Range button no longer appears in the metrics table interface

### 2. Button Creation and Event Handling Removal
- **File**: `src/dom/filters/FilterControls.ts` (lines 165-196)
- **Changes**:
  - Removed custom range button creation in `buildFilterControls()` method
  - Removed `openCustomRangeModal()` method entirely
  - Cleaned up button event handling logic
- **Impact**: No more programmatic creation or event handling for the custom range button

### 3. Modal Archival
- **Source**: `src/CustomDateRangeModal.ts` and `src/dom/modals/CustomDateRangeModal.ts`
- **Destination**: `docs/archive/legacy/ui/CustomDateRangeModal.ts`
- **Action**: Moved the complete modal implementation to the archive for historical reference

### 4. Import and Reference Cleanup
Updated the following files to remove `CustomDateRangeModal` imports and usage:

#### `src/dom/modals/index.ts`
- Removed `CustomDateRangeModal` export from barrel file
- Kept only existing modal exports

#### `src/dom/modals/ModalsManager.ts`
- Removed `CustomDateRangeModal` import
- Removed `openCustomDateRangeModal()` method
- Kept `openDateSelectionModal()` as the replacement

#### `src/dom/filters/date-range/DateRangeService.ts`
- Replaced `CustomDateRangeModal` usage with user-friendly notice
- Updated `openCustomRangeModal()` to show: "Custom date range selection has been moved to the Date Navigator. Please use the 'Date Navigator' button instead."

#### `src/events/DreamMetricsEvents.ts`
- Removed `CustomDateRangeModal` import
- Replaced modal instantiation with notice directing users to Date Navigator

#### `src/events/FilterEvents.ts`
- Removed `CustomDateRangeModal` import
- Simplified `openCustomRangeModal()` to show informational notice

#### `src/events/EventHandler.ts`
- Changed `modalsManager.openCustomDateRangeModal()` to `modalsManager.openDateSelectionModal()`

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- Users had two separate interfaces for date selection:
  1. "Custom Range" button → `CustomDateRangeModal` (simple date picker)
  2. "Date Navigator" button → `DateSelectionModal` (comprehensive calendar interface)

### After
- Users have one unified interface:
  - "Date Navigator" button → `DateSelectionModal` (comprehensive calendar + text input)
- Clicking old custom range references shows helpful notice directing to Date Navigator

## Technical Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant date selection modal
2. **Simplified UI**: Single date selection interface reduces user confusion
3. **Better UX**: `DateSelectionModal` provides both calendar and text input methods
4. **Maintainability**: One modal to maintain instead of two
5. **Consistency**: All date selection now uses the same optimized interface

## Backward Compatibility

- No breaking changes for end users
- Old functionality gracefully redirects to new interface
- All date selection capabilities preserved and enhanced

## Files Archived

- `src/CustomDateRangeModal.ts` → `docs/archive/legacy/ui/CustomDateRangeModal.ts`
- `src/dom/modals/CustomDateRangeModal.ts` → (deleted, duplicate)

## Verification

The removal was successful as evidenced by:
1. No more "Custom Range" button in the UI
2. All imports and references cleaned up
3. Build process completes without CustomDateRangeModal errors
4. Date Navigator provides all needed functionality

## Future Considerations

The archived `CustomDateRangeModal` can be referenced if any specific functionality needs to be ported back to the `DateSelectionModal`, though the current implementation already provides superior functionality with both calendar and text input modes.
