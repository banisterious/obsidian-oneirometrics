> Met with Lila Derickson for the first time today via telehealth. Some quick notes regarding areas where she can be of help:
> 
>   - Identify neurodivergent traits
>   - Clinical autism DX
>   - (Help with?) autistic burnout (a term *she* introduced after hearing me talk about my breakdowns without having used the term)

> Not the best of weeks. Overspent on travel on Sunday when the pharmacy didn’t have my meds ready after getting a free ride there. Spent $40 on Uber. Probably should have used the bus, but its damned cold out. (Ice & snow everywhere). Worse, they could not dispense my Adderall yet as its time-locked. (Dr. Lumos set a “no earlier than” date on it - for good reason, of course.) So I’m struggling quite a bit with my default state.
> 
> Speaking of the cold, my heater broke over the weekend and worse, the fan turns on automatically every few minutes and blows cold air on me. Since my place is currently a mess, I’m reluctant to have maintenance pop in and fix it (which is ridiculous, I know). Overall feeling pretty miserable. I did cut my hair, though, and feel pretty good about having done so and about the result.

> Met with Lila today. Will be taking a [[2024 Autism and ADHD Assessment Report|series of three tests]] to identify autistic traits (CAT-Q, RBQ-2A, RAADS-R). More info about the tests: [Embrace Autism: A summary of the autism tests & scores](https://embrace-autism.com/a-summary-of-the-autism-tests-and-scores/).

> Thinking about the autism evaluation tests I took yesterday, I am reminded me of these comments I made in 2022:
> 
> - Chandra admitted up front that I’m a perplexing case given that I’m an adult with PTSD and depression, and the findings were somewhat inconclusive w/r/t ADHD and ASD as a result, due to overlapping symptoms and possible root causes. Couple of interesting things:
> - the eval did not include ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule)
> - the report did not seem to mention masking or anything sensory related
> - the eval report did not take into account my brother and my daughter, who present many (most, on the part of my brother) of the same ASD/ADHD symptoms that I do, end neither of them have a history of PTSD or depression (nor my parents, who have depression but not PTSD)
> - the eval report did not really dig into the likely relevance of my nonverbal learning disability DX, or my auditory processing disorder DX

> Had a meeting with Lila this morning.
> 
>> [!meetingsummary]- Meeting Summary
>> ### Central Auditory Processing Disorder report
>> - She felt it supports many of the observations we have made.
>> - She is wondering if the issue is contributing to a hinderance to integration.
>> 
>> ### Adderall alternatives and supplements for drug holiday days, or in general
>> - Stratera (Atamoxatine) is a nonstimulant medication that can be taken with Adderall, or between doses. Good for drug holiday days, can also be taken between doses.
>> 
>> ### Pharmacy shortage
>> - Call around to find in stock
>> - Talk to prescriber about other stimulants that might have availability as a backup plan
>> 
>> ### Supplement supports for days without
>> - Tyrosine amino acid that is a precursor to dopamine
>> - Saffron in supplement form (30-90mg is common)
>> - Exercise
>> 
>> ### Mindfulness is a versatile tool in general
>> - Could be used during sessions, or between them
>> - Look at Healthy Minds app https://hminnovations.org/meditation-app
>> - 1- or 5-minute exercises. Notice the breath. In breath and outbreath. Allow everything else to fall away. Notice those sensations, explore the moment.
>> 
>> ### Other “identity”
>> - Could be a nervous system pattern, rather than an actual identity

> Last week, [Patrick McGinley](https://murmerings.com) let me know that my [Till the World Will Sing Again](obsidian://open?vault=BanisterArchives&file=Tapes\02%20Bryan\Till%20the%20World%20Will%20Sing%20Again%2FTill%20the%20World%20Will%20Sing%20Again.md) submission was greenlighted and would be posted to his [Framework Radio](https://frameworkradio.net/2024/02/877-2024-02-18) website soon. I had submitted it to him a few months back after months of work trying to get it right. I’m absolutely an amateur at this stuff, but I had a lot of fun and learned a great deal.

>> this edition of **framework:afield**, entitled ***til the world will sing again***, has been produced in the united states by **john banister**. producer’s notes:
>> 
>> In a 1986 cassette tape collection I was fortunate to acquire, my late, great uncle Bryan shares reel-to-reel recordings from the 1970s in which he and his sister, Junelle, played piano and sang songs and hymns from their younger days. These “tape letter” cassette tapes were passed around by various family members in the 1980s and in this selection, I have included a few clips of Bryan describing what he is sharing in addition to the songs and hymns performed by the brother and sister duo.

>> Last summer I set out to fully document the contents of an old family cassette tape collection from the 1980s. While exploring my great Uncle Bryan Banister’s tapes one evening, all of a sudden I heard the sounds of singing and piano accompaniment. Surprised by the unexpected discovery, I played the tape several more times, and then went through the other six tapes recorded by Brian.
>> 
>> The practice of recording and sending tape messages between members of my grandfather’s generation (usually consisting of informal and intimate one-way conversations) was quite popular during their adult years. These particular tapes of Bryan’s were recorded in the 1980s, but the music that he was sharing on them was actually from the 1970s -- he was simply capturing the the output of his old reel-to-reel tape recorder on his more modern cassette tape recorder.
>> 
>> The music in question dated from a few occasions when he and his sister, Junelle (both in their early 50s at the time) visited with one another. My grandfather’s family being very musically oriented, performing songs and hymns together during such visits was apparently quite common. It allowed them to bond in a way that evoked fond memories of doing the same while growing up.
>> 
>> A few months back I submitted a one-hour arrangement drawing from this collection to a syndicated program called Framework Radio. Brian introduces at the beginning and wraps up at the end, but the bulk of it is just the sibling duo singing, playing piano, and bonding.
>> 
>> At the very end, Bryan says, “…you might stow this away in the archives, and somewhere along the way your children, or grandchildren, or whatever, might enjoy listening to this.” I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

>> [!meetingsummary]- Meeting Summary
>> 
>> We discussed my progress with establishing a daily mindfulness practice, and I passed on the proposal to try it out in session, as I didn’t think there was a good chance that it would be successful in that setting.
>> 
>> ### “Other Self”
>> 
>> Lila has described this other self as a possible “nervous system activation”. She also, like Andrea, uses the “inner child” (internal family systems theory) label.
>> 
>> Lila’s comments: sometimes when there’s a dynamic like this -- when it seems that the inner child part is in control of emotions -- that’s because a person’s caregivers may not ~~have had the skills to~~ have sufficient emotional maturity of their own in order to teach me when I was a child those skills. Perhaps they did their best, but there was misattunement.
>> 
>> Continuing with the parent-child model, she proposed that I try something she referred to as “reparenting”: as the adult that I am now, offer those adult skills (support, compassion, etc.) to the child.
>> 
>> Lila further observed: when encouraging that younger part to cooperate more and it responds with a “no”, what might happen if (rather than trying to convince it to shift) I instead try holding space for them. (“Why don’t you want to do this, or what do you need.”) An idea then occurred to me: encourage, entice, role-model, play.
>> 
>> Lila asked me: are there any somatic (body/physical sensation) responses? I have not noticed any (maybe in the stomach)?, and she suggested asking myself, while in the practice, if there are such physical sensations.
>> 
>> ### Demand Avoidance
>> 
>> She then had a thought related to demand avoidance: one potential skill or approach might be to give myself a choice or option. Something to experiment with: when I notice that I have an intention to do something, give myself the choice between now or in 15 minutes. Another idea, borrowing from something Neil Gaimon once wrote about going into a “writing place”: I don’t have to write, but I can’t do anything else.”
>> 
>> My current plan: 
>>  - develop strategy for communication with the other self
>>  - draw from parenting best practices
>>  - ask myself if there are somatic sensations happening
>>  - try asking the other self what it needs

> Andrea and Lila are having me explore the possibility of establishing a partnership of sorts with another part of my personality. One that begins with an agreement to show mutual respect and a commitment to cooperate. Allow me to correct something: I am the one who decided to explore this. They are merely encouraging me to look more closely at the relationship. This other part of me could be described variously as my shadow self, my dark side, my repressed subconscious, or my wounded inner child (the way Andrea frames it) or (as Lila has described it) a “nervous system activation”, but I tend to look at it as an unintegrated part of myself, though the other descriptions are also accurate, I think. In any event it seems fairly clear that this part of me exerts a certain amount of control over certain behaviors that/would like to change.

>> 
>> Hey John,
>> 
>> Thanks for sharing this with me! It is lovely and interesting to hear these songs, conversations, moments of monologue and of background comments from other folks in the room. Bryan and Junelle are incredible. He’s such a good player, it all flows so naturally, their duet and their fumbling as they try to remember the tune. Some of the tunes are great.
>> 
>> It’s strange to have a nostalgic feeling for something that existed when we were just born — maybe it’s that the parents and uncles were about the age we are now. There’s no way to listen to it without feeling how much of the world is lost, how many moments or traditions are buried in a shoebox somewhere… Such a project, in the understated way that you did it, pays respect to something beautiful which itself never asked to be noticed and therefore is all the more genuine and moving.
>> 
>> There are some funny moments. I couldn’t make out exactly what was happening during the thing with the dog barking and someone saying to someone else to get that cat down from there — do you know what I’m referring to?
>> 
>> The show’s concept is intriguing, and I’m happy you found such a fitting venue for these found tapes and the work you’ve done on them. I like your intro. The whole thing is great. I have listened to only the first third but will continue.
>> 
>> PS did you look up Phil Silvers? Someone says to Junelle and Bryan at one point that he reminds her of Phil Silver. The Sgt Bilko show (a lot like Hogans Heroes) seemed vaguely familiar, when I looked it up on YouTube, I may have seen a rerun when I was a kid…
>> 
>> Hope you’re well. Let’s connect on the phone sometime.

>> [!dream-diary] Illicit [[Dream Diary#^20240418-illicit|Dream Diary]]
>> 
>> Near the end of the dream, I found myself theorizing that someone had been smuggling an unknown substance from the honey-producing facility through a hole in the structure’s roof and all the way up to the realm of the gods, where it then somehow played a role in the sudden and untimely death of their principle god, whose effect was devastating. But not final, as there was talk not long after about birthing a new god, who would have to start out as an infant. This didn’t seem so bad.
>> 
>> I had a wife whose teeth—as well as the rest of her mouth interior, for that matter—were made of stainless steel. She could extend and retract her incisors and she relished the unsettling effect that this had on me. I also had a beautiful companion, who nervously but proudly rode her horse into the arena, knowing that I cherished her (and, more on point, any opportunity to show her to the world). Pointing out that she was not my wife, when asked, made me sad for some reason. On this occasion she wore archer’s gloves and, now that I think about it, she had no bow. Her horse spooked in the arena not too long after she rode in there, which she later described as the “heebie-jeebies”, and he grew more and more frantic as he tried to find his way to the door to escape the frightening environment.
>> 
>> At an earlier point in the dream, there was a complicated series of events featuring a fairy creature who started out in the form of a pig, and a more obscured (to me as observer) entity who by the end of the sequence was cat- or foxlike. The two entities took to one another right away, and on the first day of their meeting the cat or foxlike creature—who I think was in human form at this time — effected the transformation of the pig fairy entity by saying a magical phrase that resulted in the unlocking of unlocked certain abilities and qualities that had been suppressed. For the first time (at least, since this meeting) she could speak, and this in turn allowed her to perform quite a wide variety of powerful magical spells, the first of which she used to change form (I don’t recall which form or forms she changed to now, I’m afraid). She also began transforming the home and general environment, and the effect this had was astounding, although also murky to me now as I try to recall the dream.
>> 
>> As these two creature grew closer, at some point they perhaps inevitably began to explore the more romantic elements of their budding relationship. They ran into some difficulty, however, when they could not figure out how to mate—this was due, I think, to an anatomical incompatibility. This struggle led a fair amount of friction (no pun intended, I swear) and things got pretty tense when at one point the pig fairy was inspired to activate compatible cat/fox pheromones, operating under the theory that this might help bridge the gap with her intended partner. Conversely, it only resulted in confusion for the cat, who was obligated to follow a set of complicated feline rituals and protocols which the pig fairy entity was unfamiliar with. The cat/fox, subject to these rules and to the opinions of his tribe (who was apparently monitoring things to some extent from some unknown vantage point), grew confused and alarmed when he was beset by the scent, although this could also have been in part due to her awkward timing, as she was unfamiliar with how to use the experimental ability on an unfamiliar creature.

> I set the intention, earlier today, to put down some thoughts about how I might proceed with my dad, who I think may be struggling with some information that I shared with him some weeks back about my [[2024 Autism and ADHD Assessment Report|ADHD]] & autism diagnoses. According to my mom (who was the unfortunate and surprised recipient of an email from my apparently confused and distressed dad) he seems to be operating under a theory that the drugs he took in the 1960s played some kind of role in my unusual brain wiring. I’m also thinking that he may be burdened by unprocessed feelings of guilt and shame for having verbally abused me when I was young – feelings that I believe he has been carrying around for a long time. This is the extent of what I know at this point, and it isn’t much to go on, but for the past few weeks I have been contemplating taking some sort of action in an effort to unburden him, and to set the record straight on the silly idea he has about what could be factoring into my neurodivergent status. There are some obstacles that I can’t quite see a way around, however. One, his thoughts and feelings were expressed to my mom and not to me. Two, I don’t have the full picture on what he is thinking and feeling.

> Yesterday I met with Aaron (my step brother) over video chat with the objective of assessing his current mental health situation & identifying any areas he might need help with. Right off the bat I realized that I’d probably miscalculated, and overlooked his tendency to fill a space with the sound of his own voice, and his apparent difficulty in focusing on elements of an interaction that don’t somehow already map to familiar thoughts, feelings or experiences. I think there are probably a few reasons why he does this/is this way but the most obvious one to me is that it’s a pretty good way to protect himself. Whatever the reasons are, I found myself regretting not having anticipating this and feeling unsure about how I might adapt. Ultimately I just listened, encouraged him, asked a few questions, and took notes. It’s the notes, I realized this morning, that will guide me through the next steps as I attempt to connect with him in a different way.

> These days conversation is my platform of choice when in connecting with a person. It wasn’t always that way, and each time I notice my mom’s (or someone else’s ) contrasting preference for written communication, it recalls to mind that I felt that way myself once. I think this began to change at some point in the past few years, as I began to develop my voice and started to see that speech provided a more agile, flexible and nuanced way to reach someone else’s experience (and get across a focused reflection of your own). So when something like this happens I remember that I’m a little rusty at writing — particularly written communication. Nevertheless, this will be how/reach him, I hope.
> 
> I think my intention will be to describe a version of me to Aaron, and to mix in a little history - recent history, I mean. It needs to be focused and relevant, and not too verbose. He needs to see within one or two short paragraphs that reading further will actually prove to be interest/and helpful in some way. (I suppose/could have simply said “create a hook”.) It needs to tell a story, needs to resonate in a way that makes it feel vital to comprehend, and it needs to promise and deliver on that promise fairly quickly. I’ll borrow from the tired recovery tool of one’s story, but it only needs one or two elements of that, as recovery do only one dimension of my (and his) struggle. As I put these thoughts down, it strikes me that writing something like this — with an audience or without — is long overdue. Helping Aaron may help me.

> This has been a chaotic couple of weeks, each day filled with worried technical troubleshooting and an apparently endless supply of new (and often seemingly unconnected) issues and problems. As chaotic, confusing and distracting as it has been, I’ve still enjoyed the mental puzzles. Most of the time, anyway. There have been impactful consequences, in the form of an additional layer of mild annoyance and frustration as I recall how far off track these bizarre equipment and device failures have brought me, not to mention the low-key dread that comes with wondering what the next problem will be and how long I might still have to work on the current set before another assault forces me to make a decision about what should take priority. At one point a couple of days ago I was in the bathroom and noticed that my shower curtain seemed to be drawn further open than I had remembered, and for a few seconds I wondered if someone might have accidentally wandered into my apartment during the night, used the shower and then upon realizing their error proceeded to wreak havoc on my unsuspecting home network, like some sort of anti-Santa Claus (but a technically-skilled one). Even now as I put these thoughts down I recall that only an hour or so ago yet another device failed, this time the built-in ethernet adapter on my laptop.

> During the night, between dreams, the realization struck me that I may have reached a stage of some kind where the mind begins to find creative ways to heal itself. This seems to be happening both in the kinds dreams I sometimes have—ones that are painful to varying degrees—and in waking life, when I find myself more tolerant of a range of painful reflections—from those that are simply uncomfortable to those that sting and, on the far end of the scale, those that produce, when I allow them to, a swelling of grief.

>> During the night, I had another dream featuring <span style="font-size:.12em;">Cindy</span>. The setting was again in a family home where we presumably lived together, and there was once again an atmosphere colored by negative and positive associations. This time, though, I noticed that my attitude was different—more resolved, less conflicted. And that her actions & expressions were less impactful, and less significant. There was even a pivotal moment where she propositioned me, and after the briefest of hesitations, I directly turned her down. I seemed to be focused on the need to pack up my possessions—which only consisted of a single size mattress and some boxes—and leave her. During this sequence and between sequences I found myself reflecting, with an attitude of approval, that <span style="font-size:.12em;">Cindy</span> had less power over me and that I was less prone to being paralyzed and wounded by her words & actions.

>>> ![[banister-journals-20240513-p02-part02.png|400]]
>> 
>> Another story in last night’s dreams featured characters based on (I think) six Maxwell friends. I believe the roster included Aaron, Andalib, & Dan Makowski, but I can’t quite make out the identities of the three female ex-students, now, as I try to recall them. Except for a rare sense that one of them had blonde hair and may have been short & stocky.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240513-p02-part03.png|400]]
>> 
>> Most of the details of the dream are fading but I recall that the theme was defined by two elements: sacrifice and triumph. “Triumph” may not be quite right, actually, or at least not precisely the word that I’m after. (I’m looking for a word that combines elements of triumph, redemption, integration, and others that elude me.) In any case the theme was nuanced and layered. One detail I should probably mention up front was a kind of backdrop—an event which may not have been directly portrayed in the dream, but, rather, was simply understood as having happened. At a pivotal point in my time at Maxwell, according to-dream narrative, I was the subject of a ritual magical sacrifice, one that while having a catastrophic, life-altering impact on me, was nevertheless vital to the well-being of the community. The energy it harvested from this transaction served to nourish the community in some way, and it was directly responsible for positive growth and change, despite the ethics involved in the act. (Indeed, I now vaguely recall sensing guilt in their dispositions while interacting with my Maxwell friends.)
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240513-p03.png|400]]
>> 
>> There were only a few actual sequences in this dream that I can still describe. And I’m not super clear on the order, so I’ll just start with the most powerful one. Earlier I described the six friends as being characters in part because they seemed to be very clearly (in this part of the sequence, anyway) exaggerated—almost cartoonish. They wore - again, only in this one scene—superhero costumes that shared a motif of some kind. I.e. different colors for each person but the same essential design. And each bore some kind of magical “powergem” on their chest that radiated. (The dream is fading very fast now, so I should hurry up.) During this sequence another ritual took place, where each of the characters mounted different… pedestals in a strange laboratory-like room. Emotions were running high and the atmosphere was tense. Everyone, myself included (even though I couldn’t “see” much of what I was doing) was very focused on a specific outcome. As they finished stepping onto their pedestals there was a series of sounds and flashing lights as energy was transferred, I think, from them (or from their chest gems) to me. I had a sense that this transferal was not exactly what any of them wanted, but they went along with it anyway, for some reason. I remember experiencing some amount of satisfaction, mixed with pangs of grief, or something, as this sequence concluded.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240513-p04.png|400]]
>> 
>> The last sequence that I think I’ll try to describe here is shorter and less clear in my memory. In fact, I think it’s almost gone now. There was a series of events with these same characters that featured a motorscooter or motorcycle. At the end of the sequence there was a proposal to make a firm decision of some kind that would be of benefit to the group. Someone then declared something along the lines of “choose someone who you will sacrifice!”, and after a short internal deliberation, I chose to knock over the scooter and rider and steal the scooter. This seemed to upset the other characters, and some sort of chase sequence took place. Somehow I got away, and felt…restored in some way. That’s about all I can recall, except that near the end of the dream I was using that same scooter to sneak back to the same <span style="font-size:.12em;">Cindy</span> house to steal/reclaim personal possessions.

>> Ran out of meds yesterday & what a wild ride last night was. While lying in bed, preparing for a night of probably no sleep, as the pseudo psychedelic effects began to feel noticeable I reflected on the idea of the mind as a futuristic operating system that we don’t yet understand. To be clear I don’t mean so much in the metaphorical sense, I actually do wonder What it would be like to exert some amount of control over it in a way that’s vaguely similar to using a new operation system. As I lay with closed eyes I looked out at my inner mindscape, examining the familiar shapes, structures and colors that I’ve tried to study on only a few occasions that I can remember, and it struck me that what I was gazing at was tantamount to a command rooms or a studio, or workshop, or what have you. That this was a place for me and, so far as I know only me. A place where I could do my work. Where I *do* do my work, if only haphazardly and chaotically most of the time. I was seized with an impulse to study this room. To get to know it, get comfortable with it. Take command of it and make use of it. The room began to resolve itself more clearly to me then and I saw that that I was on track. I found myself growing confidant in this familiar space that I knew so well but had never explored intentionally in this way before. At that moment I gave the operation center what I felt was a fitting name. Akashic Operating System. Or AOS, as an ops center felt appropriate, even though it is actually both things. The room resolved itself more clearly now and my mind was brain with electrical activity, supercharged as it was (and still is) by the neurochemical imbalances.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240522-p02.png|400]]
>> 
>> The room was full of strange-looking consoles, contraptions and furniture, none of which I could make much sense of, and what’s really interesting to me is that over the course of the night its form and contents did not change as I kept expecting it to and as would be consistent with a hallucinatory construct of this kind. It was as though it (or I) knew its form and had no need or desire to show itself as anything else, no matter what the adventures I embarked on shortly after brought us. It was also welcoming and warm - my place.
>> 
>> The Operations Center dissolved as I moved forward and *through* it and I soon found myself standing in a strange garden that belonged tp what appeared to be a manor. Even though the setting appeared to be outdoors I couldn’t help but feel that it was not and indeed, when I looked up I could not see a sky. The space was vast but [the] full extent of where I was was vague. I walked forward again and moved into the manor, soon finding myself in a quaint parlor. The place was still and I couldn’t sense anyone about, and yet I didn’t feel necessarily alone. It was almost as though the person or persons who resided here had just stepped or to-the room. Or maybe they were still in it, but were out of phase with my reality, or I with theirs.
>> 
>> I want to note that I was still awake in my bed. Each time I stirred and opened my eyes and then closed them again everything that had been before me was again as it was, and did not change except when the situation demanded it.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240522-p03.png|400]]
>> 
>> And so it did. I soon shifted and rose up into the air as I wanted to explore this odd place. I discovered then that I could manipulate the environment and command it top produce things for me. I don’t recall what sorts of things I did in those early moments, however as the night I had was long, rich with revelation after revelation, and exhausting.
>> 
>> I remember the parlor was well decorated with knick-knacks, some strewn on the thick, umber-colored rug. The place definitely felt lived in. The internal architecture of the place was a little confusing. I don’t recall seeing a kitchen or bedrooms, and in fact the only other room, at least for the time being, wasn’t even a room but a courtyard surrounded by steep, tall arena steps, the top of which connected to what looked to be a rickety wooden bridge. As I stood there in what I now regarded as a small arena (a small arena for small combatants and performers? The steps seemed to indicate a normal stature) I became aware of movement. Neither a man nor a boy, he had rust-colored hair and flitted around in the air held up, supposed, by invisible wings. He seemed to take an interest in me, and treated me as a sibling or an old friend. He seemed to be as unfamiliar with the place as I was and even more interested—anxious, even—to explore it. And so we did. Over the course of the night my new companion and I wandered from room to room, picking up every new object and investigating every architectural feature, with the aim to identify how it all connected up and to this mysteriously wonderful place we were in and, even more importantly, how it all connected back to us. Sadly, as wonderful as it all was, most of the details are now lost to me.

>> In one dream, someone asked me to describe what it was like to make the run—”is it the same every times and is it always fraught with danger?” It varies in both respects, as a matter of fact, I clarified, then I turned and dropped into the water, almost as if to demonstrate, even though the run had already been planned. Ahead and below me I could see the start of the tunnel which would take me to where I wanted to go, which darkened for a spell and then, when it opened up to reveal a cavern, was flooded with inexplicable ight. Creatures were everywhere in this dense biome, an didn’t seem to mind one another much. I continued forward and there coming towards me up ahead I could see it, a blue whale, who seemed to notice me at the same time I noticed her. I knew she was no threat but I was terrified of her size just the same and her approach filled me with a kind of dread. Still, I moved forward and was determined to reach my goal. Then movement behind and to the side. I saw it just in time. The great white seemed to be grinning as it lunged & I dodged, but that was just the effect of having lips that evolution hadn’t gotten around to when it finished with the chompers. Before it completed its turn to try for me a second time, I’d slipped between the fronds of a bright green sea plant and then between two unidentified benign creatures, was back in the center of the tunnel and closer to the Whale, and then through at last and in safer waters. Without pausing I swam the final twenty feet or so and reached my midway destination: the crab bed.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20240601-p02.png|300]]
>> 
>> Adorned with an abundance of plant  life, the bed was elevated above the sea floor — perhaps to feet or so. Standing upon it I repeated a familiar ritual with a creature who did not resemble anything that one would normally expect to see on an ocean floor. I don’t remember much beyond this moment now, other than that at one point near the end of the ritual I raised my arms up for some reason, and they were crab claws. I also recall traversing the aforementioned tunnel again, a couple of times, narrowly evading the shark, aided at one point by temperature differences in certain parts of the waters.

> To return to the Jack Vance project before I was interrupted I was going to go onto mention that the reading order that I normally follow in book series is usually based on publication order and sometimes (e.g. in Bernard Cornwell’s Sharpe series) story events timeline. With Vance’s books — or rather the ones I’m looking at here — the matter is complicated somewhat due to a criteria added when I learned that he wrote a number of stories and books that technically took place in the same universe (the Gaean Reach) but that were not explicitly identified as being in the same series. And to complicate matters a little further, the “unified timeline” doesn’t match book/story publication order. When this began to break my brain a little, I moved all my planning notes over to a diagram-like document.

> Unplanned emotional upheaval this past week, starting when I pulled out some old physical journals and proceeded to scan them. Not long after, I found myself confronted with experiences I wasn’t prepared to think about again, beginning with the events surrounding Mike Brady’s death in 2003. Of particular note was a theme of contact avoidance in the form of unanswered, unread, unopened letters from him. The latest of which escalated to a sharp, kind-hearted reminder that we deserve better from others because they love us. Sitting there in my hotel room and reading this for the first time, I was overwhelmed by the intensity and the strangeness, made even stranger by the fact that in the background the TV was playing an episode of “Carnivàle” with a scene set at a Día de los Muertos festival, chosen by the network to match the current date. At the time, this was a lot to take in and felt like too much. Now, as I caught sight of and glanced through the memory, it felt overwhelming all over again.
> 
> This theme continued to haunt me repeatedly over the course of the week, in perfect harmony with the pattern of events during the years that followed that spooky night in 2003. After scanning and importing these raw journal entry pages, I came across an archive of material that had never been dealt with after its export some months back. Dating from 2003 to the present, it contained recorded phone conversations, voice messages, texts, and call logs from everybody in my life. Diving in with the intent to organize and clean it up, it wasn’t long before past choices and actions (and inactions) confronted me again. I don’t yet understand why, given how much pain this was clearly causing us, I was doing this to myself.

> The first encounter was not particularly surprising and I was somewhat prepared for it: The one who shall not be named, who nearly destroyed me in 2011 and 2012. I’m not going to say anything further on that, and in the same spirit, I was very quick to squirrel away the files in a folder named “Don’t” without so much as scanning a single text. I knew what was in there. (Actually, this particular set I had already gone through some months back when I first recovered the media.)
> 
> With that out of the way, I proceeded with the rest, prioritizing family members, close friends, and anything else that struck me as interesting. I didn’t shy away from any of it, but I did my best to listen to and read only as much as absolutely necessary in order to determine dates, identities, and, in many cases, subjects. I moved quickly and efficiently through the files, occasionally getting sidetracked by puzzles that required solving, and as of this afternoon, ten days later or so, I’m up to early 2019 with a total so far of 8,831 files and 1.87 GB. Only a few more years to go.
> 
> I think it was on the second or third day that a creeping, barely noticed feeling began to come over me as the cumulative effects of sifting through the treasures yielded by an overturned rock began to take their toll. I believe a pivotal moment was digging through a file to identify the sender and seeing the words, “It’s your uncle Rick.” It’s remarkable to think that had he not chosen to mention who he was in the voice message, I might never have known about this missed (ignored) message. Well, I suppose that would be unlikely as most people identify themselves. At any rate, that sharp sensation was there again. (I should point out, by the way, that Gary and Rick died suddenly, mysteriously, and probably horrifically in 2018).[^2]
>

> 
> A day or two later, I was creating a folder and tag system for notable events when I noticed a big group off files from 2012 that were all car-related, many of them involving a towing company. On further investigation I realized what this was. In November of that year, not too long after Lindsay Earthsong and I had broken up following a bizarre meltdown she had, she reached out to me and asked me to come over and get her drunk. She was depressed because some other guy had just dumped her. Answering this call to action turned out to be a disastrous mistake. Somehow, not long before dawn the next day, I found myself emerging from a blackout while chatting with a couple of cops. At some point during the night, Lindsay had ejected me from her apartment, locked the door, silenced her phone, and (whether on purpose or not I don’t know) kept my car key and glasses. Failing together attention while still blacked out, I must have aggravated someone enough to bring the cops. Anyway, to speed things along here, what happened next was: called a cab, went home, slept, found an emergency Jetta key (but no spare glasses) cabbed back to the complex, discovered a new, mysterious flat on one of the Jetta tires arranged for a tow and returned home, and then spent the next week replacing the glasses and the key.
> 
> Coming up: medical emergencies, mental health crises, animal drama and death, distraught family members, and probably more that I’m presently forgetting.

I soon drifted over to adjacent archival materials and spent several days on the cassette and video collection, which I intend to finish documenting and organizing to the point where individual clips are pulled out of the masters, with both audio-video and audio files placed into their own folders. I’ll return to the phone media soon, however.

No commentary or editorializing this time, just the facts. I’m going to make an attempt now, here.

> - Event# 1: Michael Brady’s suicide in 2003 and my discovery, during the first day of Día de Muertos while staying in a hotel room near the location of the funeral, of a series of unacknowledged, unread, and unopened letters he had written to me in which he urged me to do better by those in my life who love me, as a gentle but semi-direct way of admonishing me for ignoring him in recent years. This memorable experience came back to me while I was digitizing one of my old physical journals a few weeks ago.
> 
> - Event# 2: Part of my transition away from eBay in 2006, and shared observations about the strange mental health crisis I was noticing.

> 
> - Event# 3.1: family photos, diaries and letters from the past century, particularly those related to me dad’s parents who’d lived remarkable and, eventually, tragic lives, with some of the themes eerily foreshadowing some of the themes in my own life. Also “found” while identifying and reorganizing old scans.( Not new materials, just stuff I hadn’t explored in a while.)

Just finished up a little clip featuring me being idle in my dorm room at Maxwell when I should probably have been studying instead. Every time I produce something like this I learn a little more. Pretty rewarding pastime.

We’ve always had a good connection but we did seem to be struggling at times with “finding the path” (or rather figuring out which path we needed to find). Trauma seems to be the operative word. I think her thinking is that if we can somehow tackle it directly, we’ll be more effective overall.

Not much else to say today except that just finished the process of splitting up Maxwell tape#1 (which I now believe may actually be 1 based on circumstantial stuff was noticing) up into 71 clips (pretty much one clip per cut). Along the way I absorbed/remembered a lot from what was going on then and learned a lot about both editing in and kdenlive, the software I’m using.

Last Week after the change of DJ’s on at around 2AM, the oncoming DJ put on that old Funkadelic song, Maggot Brain, and it took me back to a time when I probably felt just about the worst I’d ever felt before (or at least, while as an adult).

> Whenever that song comes on, as beautiful as I still think it is, it brings with it that sense of overwhelming horror and dread that I was experiencing on that dark and lonely night. A feeling that I was near the center of a black hole, close enough that the prospect of escaping its pull was forever off the table and, worse, that my destruction wouldn’t be quick and painless. That this poll would be there for there for the rest of my probably average-length life.
> 
> I suppose I bring this up now because that’s the feeling that I was recalling as I read my mother’s email, and the divide between our respective perspectives felt wide. As well meaning as I know she is, this sentiment and concern she was trying to share conveyed, in the end, a sense that she may not feel able or be willing to recognize the hard work that I am putting in, or notice that inescapable void that—realizing that to an extent it is just an illusion—will forever be exerting its pull.

(the third I only see every 5-6 weeks, so she may not be given a chance to weigh in on the idea). Complex trauma resembles a ball of tangled yarn on a long string that runs through a person’s life, supposedly. That’s Andrea’s metaphor, anyway.
> 
> When I reflect on this (or when I check in on myself) I notice that there seems to be a struggle between two realities. One says that my issue, whatever it may actually be, is nothing like what my care team has said—no trauma, not tied to my mother or to any one other than me. Pervading this reality is a cloud of angry energy that isn’t just directed at me. The other reality—which seems to be on its back foot at the moment, entreats me to hold on and keep up the good work of moving to a place of both self-compassion and compassion for those who have hurt me over the years, and applauds the effort to integrate the bad with the good.
> 
> Saying all this now reminds me of another, less existential struggle, and one where the ultimate consequences of the outcome—the ultimate impact on me, I mean—are possibly much less clear to me. This one is between a naïve, idealistic, and noble wish to make known to my mother the ideas that I have about the nature of what she does, and standing on the other side is a voice urging me to resist this.

Yesterday Minha (who has stolen my heart) was amenable to 30 minutes of seeing carried around the room—none of her usual demands for alternative perspectives or sources of sensory input. For the first ten minutes or so the head swiveled and whipped around in an apparent attempt to track and study as much of her environment as possible Then, perhaps because of the drone-like quality of my singing, it began to slow and gradually lowered and rested itself on my shoulder. A few minutes later, the eyelids closed and she was asleep.

At any rate as I said the words, a black cat appeared nearby walking away from my position or perspective (didn’t feel like I had any sort of body). The Kitty paused when it heard my voice and oriented on me, seemingly curious, or maybe fascinated. It then turned and trotted over to me, and I don’t recall what happened next.

All three volumes of the 34-work omnibus are assembled and the first of the three is essentially done, minus a few thin s including copyright and edition notes. It has been a full-time job of sorts and I begin to feel a little burnt out, but it’s very satisfying. Have also been in contact with Vance’s son, planning to share a future version with him, in a month or so when it is ready.

Started a new video edit of the master for the first Bosch tape. Meaning, creating the basic cuts where footage ends and new footage begins. Also started on the audio clip exports from the Maxwell tapes. Well, the new and definitive versions, I mean — I did start that before but it was premature then. This time, with the clip times properly marked it’s much easier to be precise. I’m already a little excited about working with the audio, am hearing lots of potential when I spot check clips thinking as I go along. I’m thinking about a simple contribution to Frame­work Radio, nothing much more than strung together bits of audio and a bit of narration.

We visited my mom at one point, and after introductions I found myself explaining his throat condition (cancer survivor). Later, as we were walking down the street, at one point he made a move on me and managed to slip me the tongue before I pulled away in surprise, indicating in (I think) non-verbal language that I didn’t share the sexual attraction. This made me a little sad, as I empathized with him.

I suspect she has a negative perception of what’s going on there, and that I haven’t done a good enough job at illustrating my perspective and disposition. My past and the collective past of everything connected to me (namely family and friends) is everything to me because it <u>is</u> me. Its an identity thing.

>> Story begins on a rocky boat that is headed towards a distant beach, under the onslaught of rain and wind. The boat is filled with infantry men who are clutch in the sides of the boat and watch in the approaching beachhead. Our protagonist a young corporal, sits in the middle of the bunch, holding his helmet to his head with one hand and the boat edge with the other. eyes blinking away rain and seawater ‘as he considers the path ahead.
>> 
>> Idea: through periodic visions, protagonist experiences a connection to future generations that make no sense from his perspective, an that he interprets as the effects of highly stressful combat conditions/experiences. Unbeknownst to the reader, what appears at first as a one-way transmission turns out to actually be two-way communication. Both parties are influenced in various wars by it, and over time it gradually becomes clear that collective trauma handed down over multiple generations has effects In both directions. Or put another way, the trauma appears to have no single origin, as the past is seemingly just as affected by the future as the future is affected by the past. later in the story this changes, and a single set of events turns out to be the most significant race of the puzzle, and they are not the types of events one might expect.)

In the segment I still remember Tim was semi-homeless and crashing at my place while struggling with finances, work and such. For a while he had been taking care of Gesso (my dog)[^1] for some reason I can’t recall, and when I reclaimed Gesso from him the poor little guy was in pretty bad shape. Much of his skin had sort of rotted or otherwise fallen off, leaving something like half his skeletal structure exposed, and he was missing a leg. This made me very sad.

I hung out with him in various locations including Cody’s Books where we worked and in somebody’s home. I, on the other hand, did not appear to be doing very well, although I didn’t seem to be fully cognizant of the fact. I remember trying to connect with others and getting frustrated when I was literally unable to get anyone’s attention. Then I was off on my own and seemed to have trouble reaching intended destinations via bus and later foot. Finally, towards morning I reached a light rail station and was nearly killed as I tried to move from one train to another. The first one shut its doors as soon as I stepped through them, and both trains then departed the station at once, leaving me stuck in the narrow space between them, fighting to stay upright and avoid falling and dying.

>> Dreamt of several characters on a large, advanced spacecraft that was in orbit around a dormant earth-like planet. A small team of 2-3 people explored abandoned facilities, where they investigated and found that this was a civilization of people whose current absence had something to do with latent meta abilities of some kind. One female team member, after examining a being who was in stasis, went on to find a tiny mechanical beetle that was carving out a small section of wall, and upon plucking the beetle and dropping it onto the ground she somehow determined that this beetle (its behavior or its existence, not sure) was a vital clue in the mystery of what happened to the race. At around this point time shifted and I was back on the ship (my point of observation, that is). I was then shown the events which occurred a day or so before, except that something changed, and the events played out differently. The same female crew member activated something (I forget what) and suddenly her own latent psychic abilities were able to manifest. This in turn triggered something on the planet and a projection of energy shot up and engulfed the crew, and transformed their facial features. The implication was that the effects of the transformation were somehow directly linked to the new abilities. Memory fades at this point.

> Along the way I came across an old journal entry where my father [[2007#banister-michael-rogerairplane|relates in an email]], the story about his brother finding the famous “Airplane Pot’’ plane with some climbing buddies while in Yosemite.
> 
>> One winter he was backpacking in the high country there (9,000 feet plus), and he and his companion came upon a little frozen lake with a small plane stuck in the ice near the shore. The belly of the plane was under the ice. Roger and his friend walked out onto the wings of the plane, jostling it as they did so, which caused the ice to break and allow a bale of individually wrapped bricks of marijuana to pop up to the surface. Roger opened the cockpit and saw that the pilot was dead. He reached into the pilot’s vest pocket in his jacket looking for ID, and pulled out a wallet with around $10,000 in it.
>> 
>> Roger and his friend then emptied their backpacks, refilled them with the bricks of marijuana, and hiked down off the mountain. They made a couple of more trips before they had brought down all the dope. Then they mentioned the plane to the rangers, who retrieved the body and disposed of the plane. After about a year of selling the weed to their friends in the valley and elsewhere, Roger had apparently decided to become a dope dealer full time, although that part of the story he never told me directly. The rest of the story he told me after I had come home from the Peace Corps.
>> 
>> I didn’t keep up with Roger’s life for the next several years, while I was in grad school in Seattle and Berkeley. Then I went to Istanbul for two years to work as a librarian. When I returned in June 1981, I talked to Roger on the phone just to say hi, I’m back. It was a Monday. The following Thursday, my sister called me to tell me Roger had been shot dead. We eventually pieced together the facts: he had been trying to sell a kilo of cocaine to some acquaintances of his girlfriend, and he and she were killed for their efforts. Both of them left behind little kids, though the kids were not related to each other. Roger’s son, Jason, is now 29 years old and living in San Francisco.

>> ## The Untold Story Behind the 1977 Yosemite Plane Crash—and the 6,000 Pounds of Weed On Board
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-01.jpg]]
>> 
>>> *When an airplane smuggling a load of high-grade marijuana crashed in a Yosemite lake, a gold rush of climbers hauled out a fortune in brick weed right under the noses of the authorities.*
>> 
>> ### Updated Dec 13, 2023
>> 
>> **One winter morning in 1977,** two young waiters at The Ahwahnee hotel—crown jewel of national park lodges—set out on snowshoes for an over-nighter in the Yosemite backcountry, dropping LSD for good measure. Six miles out they found an airplane wing and a debris trail. Once the acid wore off, they beat it back to the valley and alerted rangers of a probable plane wreck. Agents from The National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, the DEA, and Customs, quickly assembled in the valley.
>> 
>> Customs sent a Vietnam-era Huey from San Diego to shuttle the Feds to the crash site, at Lower Merced Pass Lake, just below timberline and 16 rugged miles from Valley Central. Over the following days, federal officers hauled out over 3,000 pounds of Mexican marijuana. Then logistics and an approaching storm shut down the operation. Given the waist-deep snow and marathon trudge from the Valley floor, the park superintendent chose to wait for the spring thaw to complete their recovery operation. Divers couldn’t extract the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot, who were left entombed in the frozen cockpit.
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-02.jpg]]
>> 
>> *John Glisky, the pilot who died in the crash. This photo is him messing around in Vietnam, where he had been a US Army pilot. Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss*
>> 
>> One of the dead airmen was former Army copter pilot Jon Gilinsky. Gilinsky’s attorney, call him Atticus, was alerted that his client was dead. In fact, Atticus hated the drug-runner’s guts, but still had a shine for Gilinsky’s wife. The two were an article back in college. The widow received no information about her dead husband except that his plane crashed somewhere in the valley. As a favor to his old flame, Atticus drove a rental car to Yosemite and spooked around, eavesdropping on DEA agents still slumming in the Yosemite Bar, and was able to get the low-down on the dead pilots and the salvage operation just abandoned. I wonder if Atticus knew that the night before the crash, at a dirt airstrip in Baja, California, Gilinsky had loaded 6,000 pounds of dope onto his twin engine Howard 5000. Atticus did know that the fuselage was still up at the lake, under the ice, as well as Gilinsky’s and the co-pilot’s bodies, along with whatever weed the feds had not recovered.
>> 
>> On his last night in Yosemite, according to Greg Nichols, in *Men’s Journal,* Atticus noticed a fire burning in a campground nearby. “He lit up some Thai stick,” wrote Nichols, “and sauntered toward the trees. He found about a dozen young climbers around a fire, so he passed his joint and told them a fantastic story about an airplane full of dope.”
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-03-N80BD.jpg]]
>> 
>> *The last known photo of the plane that crashed in the lake, in its final paint job. Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss*
>> 
>> Camp 4 regular, “Barney,” was quickly filled in (over the following week, Barney acted as a sort of ombudsman, shipping manager, and logistics director as climbers relieved the crashed Howard 500 of its remaining cargo). Barney immediately dispatched Woody, Buzz, and Skillet (I’ve changed all the names) up to Lower Merced Pass Lake. It was cold at 9,000 feet, and snowing on and off. But the trio gained the wreck site by the wee hours, where they found the crumpled fuselage augured into the frozen lake. When Skillet reached into a slushy hole next to the cockpit, and heaved out what looked like a plastic-wrapped hay bale, the small talk stopped. They hauled the bale into the moonlight and broke it open, studied it under their headlamps, sniffed it, ate it, smoked it, and were still disbelieving. But it was true: the submerged fuselage was bursting with five-kilo bales of Mexican weed. “Airplane,” as it came to be universally known. “All tops,” wrote *Mountain Gazette.* “Tight clusters of flower buds shot through with red and yellow threads. Even damp it looked sticky.” The good shit.
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-04.jpg]]
>> 
>> *This was the Park Department’s idea of keeping the entire event a secret because they didn’t have the budget to post armed rangers at the lake 24/7 until Spring thaw when they would be able to pull the plane and its load from the lake. (Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss)*
>> 
>> The storm didn’t come, rather a heat wave. And since the rangers never stationed a sentry to stand guard, the feds were none the wiser when several Barney strike teams made four trips in as many days to ransack the Howard 500. Each time they hauled out a bale, another bobbed to the surface. Since the wreck was the climber’s version of discovering the treasure ship Atocha, Camp 4 and everyone in it was duly informed. In a matter of hours, the gold rush was on and a regular mule train of climbers were tromping 32 miles to and from the lake. Some teams returned with upwards of 200-pound loads, a burden that fetched roughly $50,000 on the open market. “Hiking for dollars” they called it, and in a week’s time more than a half a million bucks worth of booty had been hauled to light.
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-05.jpg]]
>> 
>> *Climbers at the lake “harvesting” their share of the pot. You can see the size of the buds that they are holding. Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss*
>> 
>> The plane had broken up, and perhaps half of the payload was lodged under the ice, some distance from the wreck. The Feds had used chainsaws to extract the submerged bales, till the blades got dull and the storm hove to. But Pepe got the picture and returned with several Husqvarna chain saws he rented from woodcutters down in Briceburg and El Portal, just outside the park. For several days Pepe and his partners skipped around the rink, boring the ice with the buzzing saws. If a blizzard of green stuff shot from the chain, they knew where to dig.
>> 
>> Once the trove dried up (dozens had worked the site by then), Winchell tromped out and drove down to Fresno, returning with a diving mask, flippers and a wet suit. After warming up by a roaring fire, he lashed a rope round his waist and dove through a hole and into the bowls of the fuselage. God bless that rope because after 10 seconds in the ice water his limbs went dead; but when they hauled him out, Winchell had a death grip on an attaché case full of greenbacks (pilot Gilinsky’s working capital, most likely).
>> 
>> Pound for pound, the *mota* was worth gobs more than the thrashed tents, sleeping bags and cooking junk the climbers had humped to the lake, so all personal gear was abandoned. They could buy new stuff later. Soon, all across Yosemite Valley and in the small, roadside towns nearby, in tent cabins, bungalows, bathrooms and garages, tons of sodden weed was drying out. That’s when they discovered a problem. The fuel cells on the Howard burst on impact and some of the weed was drenched in av gas. “It was like going to Mexico,” said Steve, per visiting the lake. “Don’t drink the water.” If you couldn’t smell the gas, you’d find out the moment you’d stoke a pipeful, when a flame like a blowtorch leapt off the hooch. Barney said not to worry, that the tainted goods could be peddled off at top dollar. In fact, they were, and things got crazy.
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-06.jpg]]
>> 
>> *One of the climbers upon discovering the wing of the crashed airplane. This was the start of the entire event at the lake. Had the two climbers not taken a wrong turn on the trail, they wouldn’t have found the wing and subsequently the plane might have been lost forever. Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss*
>> 
>> Homer left for Berkeley in a wheezing DeSoto crammed to the shattered windows with soggy hemp. Ten days later he tooled back into the Valley driving a candy-apple red convertible Lincoln Continental with fleecy dice hanging from the rearview mirror. Butch rolled in on a chopped Harley. Hank showed back up in a buckskin suit with a Latvian bombshell who spoke almost no English and wore almost no clothes. He spent $800 in the bar the first night—even bought the rangers a beer.
>> 
>> Climbers who a few weeks before hadn’t had two dimes to rub together streamed back into the Valley and were spending cash money with all the nonchalance of a Saudi prince. Goodbye peanut butter and jelly. It was steak dinners forever and cognacs all around. When the rangers put the pieces together, Barney had already ordered most of the looters out the valley.
>> 
>> The months that followed are best illustrated by a “climbing” trip undertaken by Buzz and five others. They took a charter to New York and the Concorde to London en route to Chamonix. They had plans: the North Face of Les Droits, the Walker Spur on the Grandes Morasses, to name a few. Later, they’d swing by the Eiger. They got hung up at a “Gentleman’s Refuge” in Bordeaux, however. A few days stretched into two weeks. In fact, they never made it to the Alps at all. The stories are legion; several might be true. Twenty years later a fantastically embroidered version of “The Wreck” provided the basis for Sylvester Stallone’s hit movie, *Cliffhanger.*
>> 
>> ![[yosemite-dope-airplane-crash-07.jpg]]
>> 
>> *This was taken during the salvage operation at the lake. If you look carefully, you can see the multicolored stripe that matches that on the plane in front of the hanger. Photo: Courtesy Rick Schloss*
>> 
>> **Four years ago, down in Desert Center,** I dropped in on my old partner, Barney. Complications from hepatitis C had left him frail and housebound. I couldn’t hack seeing him like that, so I started gushing about our expeditions, decades before, to Borneo and Angel Falls, and a hundred thrilling, jackass, reckless things besides. All the whacky incredibleness that had blessed our souls. I was still bitter about missing out on Cerro Torre, however. And of course, The Wreck. While Barney and my closest friends were “hiking for dollars,” I was 335 miles south in Claremont, Ca., a freshman lit student jammed in a crappy dorm room, slogging through *The Deerslayer*. I’d only learned the details second hand.
>> 
>> Barney bummed a cigarette from his son, blew out a cloud, and assured me we were two of the lucky ones. The shit we’d survived, while so many of the original crew had marched straight off the topo map, to peaks unknown. “Nobody gets it all,” he said. A week later, like ice in a spring lake, the great champ was gone.

That is an exaggeration, but it kinda feels that way, at times. We are also in a sort of holding pattern as we await the start of an upcoming DBT skills class, scheduled to begin in a week. (!!) I’m pretty excited about the class. It’ll run until March or so. It’s split into two parts, though. Same format for each, but the idea is to repeat it. I don’t think I fully understand the reasoning there but it still makes intuitive sense.

I managed to finish the Ellis & Dave interview with about 99% accuracy or so. I have to listen to it and manually correct what Whisper AI came up with. This process seems to be pretty smooth, but has a lot of steps, and it’s more challenging when I’m dealing with multiple voices such as with the Tillman & Arch tapes where there are 3-4 voices. Not having ever heard them speak before, I have to think carefully as I link names to voices.

>> Before I turn in I’ll mention last night’s dream: a royal court who had ordered us to fetch something special from another land, a court made up of, I want to say, pale clones and whose soldier caste was enormous and bore a square head but was beautiful and godlike. We’d been carefully instructed on how to retrieve the item and where it was and why it was so desperately needed and I took our task seriously and had no doubts about our eventual success. Not to say there was no struggle — the undertaking was not intended for the shy or faint of heart. If there were any doubts whatsoever we’d have been forced to pass on it. The undertaking took most of the night and I remember practically sweating out solid bullets of concentration and escort as I painstakingly endeavored to get things exactly right. My knight companions — those square head guys, or at least, one of them — never strayed from my side, and also never cracked a smile or said a careless word. or did anything odd, which is exactly the sort of companion one would expect to take on a journey like this one. (The attitude is mostly what I mean, here.) His porcelain skin was really something. Reminded me of the skin of those vampire characters in the terrible third or fourth book in Anne Rice’s series, a skin which wasn’t precisely impenetrable but had an impervious and therefore sanctified ~~or sanctimonious quality~~ that I wouldn’t dream of trying to do the disservice of describing further. The skin, I think, was all I remember liking in that book, so she must have conjured it up from dreamstuff.

>> Extraordinary dream last night about a dichotomy of divine beings locked in a conflict. The archangels had a chief angel named Gabriella who had been trapped or frozen in time or something and when she was somehow freed the encasing or whatever melted off of her dramatically like she was shedding a layer or skin or something, and she emerged with this be grin on her face. Meanwhile the archdemon (who didn’t strike me as being particularly demonic and was pretty sympathetic) was presented with an acutely painful challenge, which culminated with a decree: “Face your daughter.” Anguished, he set out to do so and then morning had arrived and I found myself awake.

>> Partway into a dream I saw a man who possessed tremendous strength, and was carrying some sort of sling with a medium-sized rock on the end. He managed to attach himself to someone or something else and proceeded towards a castle fort surrounded by a moat. He approached a water gate and raised his sling and swung it at one site of the trellis. With great crack the gate splintered and broke apart all at once and with a second it fell, as did part of the wall. With a single leap the man was through the breach and in a water-courtyard. He swung his weapon at a wall and it crumbled, and within seconds he had flattened half the castle. He turned to face a corner tower and erased it with another swipe of his sling. In the chaos he could see residents of the castle fleeing, but his attention was focused on the fort. In moments there was nothing left. He continued swinging and smashing anyway and soon he’d cleared much of the debris that still remained. Underneath what used to be the castle could be seen dirt leaves and a bit of foliage, and shrubs began to sprout and grow. There was soon a decent sized underforest populated by the creatures who had lived there all along, underneath the former castle. The man was now no longer a man, more like a large troll with bluish-green skin, and he no longer wielded any weapon. Kneeling, he ran his fingers through shrubbery and revealed other trolls who had been either trapped or, more likely, in hiding, some larger and more ancient than himself. He communed with them one at a time, only occasionally meeting resistance, a his destruction of the fort and uncovering of the world beneath was not entirely welcome, for whatever reason. One being who was freed and not pleased was a witch, and here my memory of the dream fades into nothingness.

I don’t understand the how or the why, but somewhere inside me this idea exists and for whatever reason I believe it to be true. I know this because while I watched a young man sacrifice his own life to save a drowning boy and return him to his panicked mother I saw myself doing the same way back then, and this produced a wave of grief, envy, and anger. Now I want to know what it means.

> My experience of time moving forward has always struck me as be in odd In that it doesn’t seem to match what mane other people appear to experience. There seems to be a threshold which, when crossed, causes the future to make a sudden tea towards me in a that’s not dissimilar to the face hugger’s leap towards a host in the Alien movies. As an equation it might look something like $X-(Y\div Z)$, where X=then, Y=now, and Z=something else. So if we’re taking about imagining the afternoon when its morning, that buffer is going to be a few hours or so, and when considering a point that begins next month, my buffer is measured in weeks. So in the first case the threshold is obviously much shorter and potentially more shocking because the afternoon is upon me before I’ve even had a moment to prepare, whereas in the second example I do usually have a day or so during which I can try to absorb the experience before its on top of me. In both cases there is still complacency and then shock, though. I had a recurring dream of a model that represented this concept when I was a kid involving a spaceship floating in space, where at first the ship was suspended in place some distance off, unmoving, and then suddenly it was looming dangerously close, enormous and threatening. This terrified me and I’ve always felt sure that it represented how I experienced the stark contrast between a future point a time that is so far off that the distance is unmeasurable and meaningless, and the suddenness of it being in the now, now. How does one prepare when the buffer feels like suspended time and the crossing of the threshold happens as quickly as the pulling of a switch? I wonder if there are exercises where one can train the mind to perceive and adapt to the shortening of future time.

Also need to work on images and graphics, which is a difficult challenge because I haven’t really developed my drawing/inking/painting skills much to date. “Dream Diary” represents a unique challenge as well—not exactly sure what it will look like, assuming it isn’t just a dump of dreams I’ve had over the years. The other two pieces have a pretty clear scope, I think, but they will be a lot of work. “Going Down” just needs to go through at least a few more drafts, so while that’s a lot of work it’s pretty straightforward. “World is Waiting” isn’t drafted yet, unfortunately, but all the audio work is done, as is the transcription, which needless to say is the biggest part of the project.

> Been reading a book by Robert Olen Butler on writing and a reflection stuck so well in my head that I dreamt about it all night. Butler has a lot to sat about the relationship in between the mind and the senses, and argues that a good writer learns to write without interference from the mind. In my dreams I was fixated on this and extended the idea to dream recall. I. e. the mind is what interferes with dream recall, and one must experience the recalling of dreams through the senses. This may be why someone once suggested sketching or doodling one’s dreams instead of trying to write them down.

At the start of our convo I hadn’t even given the relationship much thought as far as how it intersects with the Interpersonal Effectiveness section of my DBT studies, and Andrea really helped me by pointing some things out and sharpening in my focus in that area. Borrowing concepts described in this week’s DBT skills training handouts and homework assignment it would appear that I am struggling with respecting my own values and beliefs, acting in ways that make me feel moral capable and effective in order to maintain (I believe) my bubble and autonomy, and to avoid having to mask. Those are the three bullets in the “Self Respect Effectiveness: Keeping or Improving Self-Respect” section.

Familiar because one of its components was something all men at least notice at some point in their lives. Unfamiliar because it was unexpected—cum is not something one normally expects to run into when going about one’s business out in the world. Also unfamiliar because it was mixed with a strong cleaning agent—another scent one doesn’t frequently encounter.

I want to not regard my time there with her as so finite and fragile and short and rare, or the rapport with my granddaughter to be like two strangers coming to terms and trying to recall if actually met before, or where they left off on a script. I want to go there knowing that <u>I go there</u> not just that I have gone there. That I am going there from a place of adoration and mutual attraction, and not from a place of hurried, inconvenient urgency. Masking for others is to create a representation as a tool for social survival, and it has no value in my relationship with Devin and Minha, and is in fact an albatross and an embarrassment. By boldly going with full intent and commitment, and going on a schedule, by leaving the mask and protective armor at home, I bring to her and to my granddaughter myself as they and I have deserved from the beginning. I believe this will result in improved self-respect and in stronger, longer-lasting bonds that I can be proud of.

>> Dreamt of a small celebration to which we invited a young woman named Aleka (not Aleke) and her toddler girl. Took place at a small, modest home owned by my family (my mother? Unsure.) Everyone took to Aleka for some reason and there was considerable attention paid to extending another invitation to her to attend another future gathering. We were planning to celebrate some sort of event related to my step-sister Myles up comin marriage. Perhaps an engagement party. I don’t know precisely because we were deliberately dancing around its label for whatever reason. One concern was that the part of Oakland where it was to take place had a reputation for being unsafe, and we worried that this might make the invitation less appealing to her and to her family, who were also invited. While hanging not at the present celebration I was gifted a pair of ski skates, a name that I just came up with as I write this entry. They resembled a narrow, light-weight longboard split in two down the center, with one foot strapped to each side, and were tread and novel. Is ski-skated quite expertly and sped through several neighborhoods with ease, even skating up walls and back down again. At one point I encountered a friend just as I’d taken the skates off and was preparing to return home. Because she was an out-of-uniform cop I scrambled to conceal a small personal supply of marijuana, a pipe, and a hand gun in my front pocket before we greeted one another. She didn’t seem to care much about any of that stuff when we did greet, but she did disapprove of my intent to carry my dog home rather than let her or him just walk.

> The pressures of subsisting without food (beyond muesli and chili) push at me and are proving to be a distraction. And yet retakes so much for me to ask myself why am I allowing myself to live this war. I mean, I understand what happens: I fail to ask for more financial support-the additional support that/needs that is-and then I over consume the few resources I do have and run out. This has been a pattern for a few rears now, I think, and it heels like its coming to a head. or at least that the pressure is mounting somehow. Maybe. Or maybe my awareness of how living this way must affect my mental health’s a little sharper lately. After all, I am taking a class that is intended to increase one’s awareness of such things and lower one’s tolerance in such a way that, when faced with a choice they make the better one, the one that favors survival and prosperity. Having a disability, or even multiple disabilities and related challenges does not excuse or justify living in this way. And yet in saying that, acknowledging that, as I shine a light on me difficult choices there’s this tone of accusation as well, and an implication that I’ve chosen a path that is harmful and dangerous, that I have compromised on my values & have disrespected myself. That doesn’t sit well with me. This idea. I want instead to focus on compassion and acceptance. Or is that the wrong choice as well? No, I don’t think it’s as simple and binary as that. These things rarely are.

Wasn’t sure where to start on a sequence with the working title, “Love and Friendship,” stalled for half a day or so, then just jumped in and started cutting and mixing, and after a couple of hours I have a little something that feels just right, even if it lacks the “love” part. That part of the working title stems from a weak love theme in my Santa Cruz footage, where Greg and Michael write loving messages on the sand. I also have footage of two different weddings on those same tapes, but not sure any of that adds up to anything particularly interesting or meaningful.

Required leaving the red line downtown and boarding blue when I had fare, so probably not much time lost, if any. Just watched a touched passenger board at a downtown stop fully bent over, with torso perpendicular to his lower body as he walked back and forth in the car, looking for a seat and complaining about people “being in my damn way”. The bent over thing was a new one on me. I grew up around people touched like him, never saw that one before.

Bunch of transit agents just boarded the train and raised my hackles regarding the status of the ticket I bought. Actually there is no doubt—it is expired. I wonder if all agents are under some kind of obligation to do spot checks, or if there’s some specific circumstance that calls for it. So far they don’t seem to care, so fingers crossed that I’ll arrive home unscathed and unchecked.

But, live been a good boy today and have been checking off all my to do boxes, so there is that. This class has been super helpful.
> 
> Proposed a sleepover for my next visit with Devin, after the holidays. Kinda excited about the idea, and it makes practical sense as it removes barriers to getting there and spending enough time there.
> 
> Resumed work on the family tape collection, focusing on Millie, her daughter Marilyn, and an unknown male voice (sounds like Tillman but I’m not at all sure). Only two tapes remain after these, Bill, which is problematic due to some sort of back round noise (I think he had a HAM radio on), and a tape tabled, “Faye Deathbed” which seems to have a disabling mechanical issue of some kind.

Didn’t manage to fully resolve rent situation, unfortunately, due to time mismanagement-was too focused on family tapes related stuff. Finished the Marilyn & Millie tapes, was charmed by Marilyn’s, definitely one of my favorites from the bunch. Reached out to Dave Thornton on Facebook, as well as to John D. Banister’s daughter, MarySue, about looking for John’s Ellis tapes. (The tapes I have are Dave’s, but at least I have John’s transcription). Sitting next to a young punk chick, regretting not having showered before leaving the apartment.

My hope is to complete the new resume and complete at least one of two profile sites—probably WorkSource Oregon, if only one. Am curious to find out if being in different surroundings will make the process smoother. Going to leverage an online “body doubling” platform, as well-place where one can drop in on a group and “get things done” while in the virtual presence of others. Supposedly boosts motivation, etc.

> Had to leave the room last evening when my mom & Nuri were railing on Yael agada. Get really tired of how she, Dan and others pick on her, wish my brother would stick up for her like I do. Devin has complained about the very same thing; hates all the negativity that comes up whenever that little girl is discussed. Personally, I think much of it stems from her and her parents not being receptive to Dana Cheryl’s unsolicited advice.

>> Spent at least a couple of hours fixing up a game map Intended for some dream people and I to play on. Once configured to the leader’s standards, he took over and turned on the game, making last minute changes such as removing all the NPC’s, and then invited even one to play. We jumped into ships and tanks and people wailed at other people, but a tank I tried to mount wouldn’t grant entry. The leader came by, tried to help me, failed, and then basically laughed at me.
>> 
>> Earlier dream also featured a virtual world, this one based on Rockstar Games GTA-like assets. For a while I was enjoying myself tooling around and doing this and that. Had some vague interactions with Rikki Eddleman (how I miss her) who was standing far away, watching me. Then some guy began to mess with me, managed to trap me in an area of the game and then reload me into a different version designed for psychological torment.

This morning I read a passage in From Where You Dream about listing words for scenes and arranging each set on individual file cards for later processing. Then a few minutes later I read about pulling still images from uncut film footage and arranging them onto “panels” in a kind a grid, for later editing.

Will drop off the checks tomorrow morning and put the situation (mostly) behind me. Trying to transcribe Bill Banister’s audio but the quality is pretty bad and he spoke with a stronger accent compared to his younger siblings. Neither the AI nor I are having an easy time of it. Reprocessed the audio, cleaned it up a little, putting it through AI once more with fingers crossed.
