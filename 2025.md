> The AI did a decent job with Bill’s voice this time around, I’m pleased to report. Left it going over night. Not sure why the results vary like that, especially since the model is closed off and running on my machine. Technically different instances of the same model, now that I think about it, but that shouldn’t account for this kind of variation in my mind.

> Bill’s [new transcription](obsidian://open?vault=BanisterArchives&file=Tapes%2F03%20Bill%2FAudio%2FAudio.md) came out about as well as can be hoped, given the circumstances. Towards the end I realized that when he repositioned the mic (or himself relative to it) the clarity improved quite a bit. Shame he hadn’t done whatever he did from the start. Still, I’m grateful that the AI did as decent a job as it did.

> Now I’m working on the EPUB document, dividing content up and such. Also experimenting with embedding audio, although I will most likely leave the audio out whenever I publish.

> Today was consumed largely by PDBTI class, where I found myself barely able to participate (while still enjoying being there). Was too distracted by various stray thoughts and projects. Hopefully I can engage better on Monday.
> 
> Forgot to attend KFJC audio production last night. We keep missing one another—when I try to attend, it’s not actually hallening, etc. Hoping the stars align better next week.
> 
> Spent the rest of the afternoon editing the Banister Tapes ePUB. Struggling with content organizaqtion. I can <u>feel</u> a structure and flow, but can’t quite access it yet, so I keep experimenting. One goal is to make it accessible to my dad while still being fairly comprehensive and complete. Wish I could include other media such as diaries and letters, but can’t within the same volume given how huge it would become if I did that.

>> Short memory of a dream where I was in a primeval world full of dangerous creatures, the most dangerous being a gigantic cross between a vulture and a dragonfly. It could traverse great distances very quickly and it was larger than several commercial aircraft put together. One of them saw and came after me and I had to dive into a swamp to escape.
>> 
>> Later dreamt of superheroes. My partner (in all ways) and I found ourselves on opposing sides of a conflict and she had stolen a McGuffin. I got it back but while fleeing my squirt gun leaked a sleep-inducing agent onto me, slowing me down. Barely made it back to base.

> Meeting with Andrea later this morning. Haven’t worked out what to bring up yet, although I will probably want to discuss my desire to body double and the obstacles I’m facing. Will also recount my recent stressors surrounding rent payment. I get the feeling that Andrea likes me, but also doesn’t know what to make of my apparent inability to make progress in certain areas. I am as befuddled as she is, and wish I could reproduce on demand what happens when I overcome a problem serendipitously, or randomly, or whatever.

> Hit a wall with writing a story. I won’t try to blame From Where You Dream, but I will note that Butler doesn’t offer much when it comes to the question of <u>how</u> to access one’s dreamspace. Maybe I should reread some Robert A. Johnson.

>> We were making toys in the outdoors, little toy soldiers and such. Chris Leblanc was off playing with another guy, with whom he was making slightly different toys. Something shifted and now we were making kites. Chris’ kite was enormous, and everyone laughed when I inquired if we should attempt to fly it. I outlined my plan which involved using vehicles—necessary due to the fact that the kite was so big and unwieldy. They all seemed to love the plan and we proceeded with success. Soon we were all sitting on top of Chris’ kite and looking out at the world.
>> 
>> I carried weapons in my butt: a sword and a knife. A female companion kept reaching into my rear pouch and taking things out. I was unable to stop her or convince her to stop, so I did my best to ignore her. We were up against vampire lords, and I knew that we were stronger and better. Then my weapon changed into a long whip and we were up against a dude with a bad attitude. He had a female companion who flirted with me, knowing that this would anger him. And it did. As we fought we made our way into a Student Union on campus and it wasn’t long before alarms went off and a warning sounded on repeat: “Fireballs incoming. Please clear out. I repeat: Fireballs incoming. Please clear out.” Sure enough, gigantic balls of fire were flung at and into the building, and threatened to kill us. “Banister, come with me,” a man said, as he escorted me to a door.

More work on organizing the [Banister Tapes](obsidian://open?vault=BanisterArchives&file=Tapes%2FTapes.md) ePUB, hoping to find inspiration for arrangement, will probably end up cutting some content (but not much). Resumed work on [Letters](obsidian://open?vault=BanisterArchives&file=Letters%2FLetters.md). Began to transcribe my personal AV journals to text. Got a call from my aunt Patty and had a really nice conversation.

> Completed the transcription process for my 18 journal audiotapes and the unedited text is sitting in another section of my journal ([[1991]], [[1992]], [[1993]]). Not much that’s a surprise in there, but there are one or two gems that I’m looking forward to dealing with. Also finished reorganizing the [family letters](obsidian://open?vault=BanisterArchives&file=Letters%2FLetters) (or mostly finished—up to the 1970s). Transcribing the rest of those is going to take forever.

>> In a gated community, my mother rented a round lake compound for a family & close friends get-together, and was rude to my friend Airyn who arrived by boat. Vague in my recollection but somehow dissed her and suggested she leave, although not in so many words. I leapt to Airyn’s defense and demonstrated that this was bullying. My mother denied this but did not want to engage. My argument was that a foot of distance in Airyn’s watercraft cost one nickel, and I produced a large bag of nickels that I had provided. And I just remembered that it was my brother who did all this and not me.
>> 
>> Was later in a large space station where I lived. There was an interpersonal conflict related to parts and I had interactions with Sam Chen, who was apparently very depressed in life now. There also lived an intelligent cyborg cat species there, and there was a small debate about whether or not they understood and/or could speak any English. One cat demonstrated that the answer was yes when they said, “cunt” to someone.

>> Dreamt of a world full of water navigation locks, with special focus on one boat in particular which had a unique configuration of my own design. Hexagonal in shape—or rather, half a hexagon and on the bow only, with other little features such as a homemade locking interface at the far front. Part of the decking in this area was pressboard, and someone pointed out to me that there were alternative materials available that would probably be superior. (Planks of some kind, not sure what they were made of.) Throughout the night was peppered imagery of words and phrases strung together purposefully (but whose significance eluded my waking brain.)

>> Had to transform part of an outpost so that it measured up. So that it demonstrated meeting certain standards, we had to make certain changes, give it certain characteristics. I began by laying pipe down and leading the pipe to a washer and dryer. I then took a little totem made of driftwood, carved to resemble a punk rocker, to my male companion. Here, I said, this is for you. He appreciated it. It was a big moment. I found myself wishing that he appreciated it even more, but I let the matter go because I respected him.

>> Dodgeball with survival elements. Self-made uniforms, roles, and rules.<br />Electronic bugs. Clones.<br />Characters:<br /> David, Shelby, Seldon, Donald, Shirley (4-titted, tall & white)
>> 
>> Wonderfully detailed and imaginative dream featuring a fully immersive Dodgeball game set in a specialized world. At least five characters, all with names starting with either D or S: David, Shelby, Seldon, Donald, Shirley (4-titted, tall & white—Shirley was an albino gorilla, just in case the implication was lost.) Dream started with me in the game, trying to figure out how seriously I wanted to take the competitive aspect of the experience, and quickly transitioned to Shelby, a super quirky and playful woman. Those who resisted competition transitioned into group- and sometimes self-imposed roles, and the group (minus Seldon and Shirley who were mostly off doing their own thing) developed its own roles as they went. They also developed a set of uniforms, with each person having their own color (all primary colors). The story centered around Shelby, who I think was the first to “think outside the box” and define her own rules, and she took on a more defensive role, opting to work cooperatively with the group and focused less on the more aggressive facets of a Dodgeball game. She introduced a mode where the group would take on elaborate and comical stances, waving their arms and legs around and they waggled about in a strange fashion, presumably as a means of warding off potential attacks and/or possibly as a way of detecting/thwarting the electronic bugs that proliferated everywhere. One of the other group members (David, I think) devised a method of hijacking and reusing these bugs, as well. The details now begin to fade.

Her first action upon touching down on Planet _______ was to gather mollusks and river plants which were found in abundance along the river banks. Soon, however, upon hearing the cries of desperation over the radio, she began to expand her gathering to include creatures which were not on her lists: groupers, river bottom plants, and strange crustaceans, much to the eventual appreciation of her crew, who would soon be famished.

Our leadership was resolved to escape the confines of the prison using force, and raised some kind of primitive ballistic weapon to the top. Before firing, we began to rotate the tower clockwise, and slowly, as we searched for a weakness in the outer wall which we knew would be marked by discoloration: the weaker parts were a more solid black, I think, and the surface was flatter. It was well known that previous attempts to breach the wall had all met with failure, and yet we were strangely confidant. In fact, it wasn’t entirely clear <u>why</u> previous attempts had all failed.

Listening to it on KFJC Sunday night was torturous for me, for some reason. One thing that I noticed was a technical, or rather, an editing oversight where I had long segments of dialogue with fewer song tracks. So it felt very imbalanced to me, on review. Hopefully that is just me feeling too close to the material. Will probably have to review it again to be sure, even though it’s probably too late to put the shit back into the horse at this point. It is possible that I’ll work on a longer version in the future, as I have an hour or so of additional interview and song tracks that I had to leave out given the constraints of the show’s 1-hour format. In addition to that, I also have transcript material that may no longer have a surviving original audio source. (I did reach out to John D. Banisters daughter, Mary Sue, but have not heard back.)

Some entries could use one more editing pass, but I’ll leave it for now. Very pleased with [[1993]] in particular as I was able to mix in a significant amount of orphaned AV content such as footage of my uncle Gary, and a couple of photographs. Today I began the thankless task of doing something similar with 2012, by starting to add orphaned phone calls that are still sitting on a drive. The editing of those will be a pain and I don’t think I’ll be able to determine what’s good and what’s not very early on in the process.

Has long since become a tedious process and it is burning me out. Am wanting to find a more creative outlet and am not coming up with ideas. Still, I can almost see the end in sight, I think. I wonder if anyone will ever appreciate or—hoping against hope—find joy in reading this stuff. My motivation is more about a sense of duty, really. I owe this to my family. Plus, no one else would probably do it, and it would all be lost otherwise. (Or so I assume, I guess.)

There’s more than enough content in the Banister Tapes that I’m still processing, slowly. I would probably start with Bryan Banister, but I like Zeb’s stuff, and Tillman & Elwood are fun. I can see myself putting Marilyn’s monologue on a pretty sound bed, too. Might look into that first, as it’d be fairly simple to do once the audio is chosen/created. Only thing there is she’s still very much alive and well. I think she’s still in her 60‘s—looks good in the one contemporary photo that I’ve seen, at any rate. My point being, “she ain’t dead yet”—so I would have to proceed with care and sensitivity. (Not that she shared anything super personal.)

>> Execution at a beach, not far from a swing set, of a close friend and long time companion, who had just recently acted in a TV show as a character whose best friend was dead/undead. He was able to walk around and interact, but only barely, and the head was only partially attached to the body. The execution of my friend I do not remember well, as it was too far back in the dream.
>> 
>> On the way to a show, I bumped into Uncles Gary and Rick and I continued bumping as we competed to be the first to reach the restroom. When he cheated and won, I yelled “you asshole” for everybody to hear. The audience reacted to this, and since the Maxwell administration was in attendance, it was immediately clear from the way nearby friends spoke to me that I would very soon be taken into custody. Sure enough, Peggy Gerlach made her appearance in the restroom foyer.
>> 
>> “Mrs. Gerlach, how lovely to see you,” I said to her. “You look great. I was just watching you on old video footage.” She didn’t know how to take this. She fixed her hands on me and proceeded to escort me to the temple. Her hands were on my arm and on my hip. “Could we not walk side by side, like this?” I asked, as I demonstrated. She was persuaded, and we ascended the shallow steps towards a group of people who were praying. On the way, we met a collection of tiny deity sculptures who required payment/worship before we could move on. I noticed that most of the people nearby were seated. “Should we sit?” I asked a young man, and he laughed at me, because he interpreted my question to have something to do with rank. “Oh, I was coming from Star Trek; I realize that this is not the Federation,” I said to him, and he laughed again. I was next escorted to a mezzanine where an assortment of people were standing, including Maxwell administration and including Mr. Gerlach, who was not only nude and fully erect, but also in amazing physical condition. “You always were a very strange case,” he said, chuckling. Some phone calls were made. Mr. Vaillancourt determined that a well-known restaurant was open and available to us, for hearing my case. “Let’s proceed,” he said, and off we went.
>> 
>> When we arrived, I was distracted by an espresso bar that stood nearby. I stood in line, spotted a cup, and took it, but it was full of holes because it was part of their signage. Then she walked up to me, and we sang amusing melodies together just as we had done before, and then we repeated one or two of the pantomime duets, rekindling our powerful attraction towards one another in the process. Except this time, at the end she formed a sad frown and several lower case Cs came out of her mouth and floated through the air. She was pregnant, she was trying to say, and it was over. I cried.

A little surprised I’ve been able to add as many photos as I have given how disorganized I have been in that area. (Poor file naming convention and not enough use of captions in the file names.)

> Wished Nikkol a Happy Birthday this morning and she thanked me. Chatted with my mother yesterday and it was very unsatisfying. She can be so negative and I don’t think she realizes this. I wish for once that she would at least try to be encouraging and show genuine curiosity about my experiences. Well, the ones that don’t connect with her personal thoughts/feelings, that is. The others tend to get dismissed or ignored.

Our focus was very “military” like and aggressive, and our tools were largely weapons, mixed with the use of dangerous organisms similar to the species in the Alien movies. I don’t remember any details but for some reason that much has stuck with me all morning.

Thank God it’s done at last. Now each entry has a focus on that section of the pages rather than on 4 days worth of entries as are shown in the raw  scans. Then I resumed transcribing the entries with missing transcriptions. I think I only have a month or two of that left to do.

At that point I’ll put the whole thing up on a website as part of my portfolio—and of course for my dad and Patty, who have been so patient.

Well, that and the office and/or Dr. Lumos could be more proactive on their end.

This medication situation has been agonizing. Managed to trace the problem to its source: Dr. Lumos made some sort of error and has my refill down for 2/25, and has been out of pocket and not reachable until tomorrow. She maintains a strict work-life boundary that under other circumstances I would greatly admire and applaud.

> Day #5 of no Adderall. The idea of letting someone go this long without such an essential medication for having a normal day-to-day existence really blows my mind and I’ll be curious to hear what Dr. Lumos has to say if the subject comes up, which I’m sure it will because I’ll be commenting on it, at least. Now that morning is getting ready to turn to afternoon, I’ll be forced to consider leaving class early to go to the pharmacy, assuming I still want to take Adderall today. I’m out of antidepressants now, which may mean more than one pharmacy trip. Aaargh. Being without meds is like being lost at sea on a boat or a ship with no rigging or broken rigging. Can’t focus enough on a single thing to feel effective, despite having accomplishments here and there as I force myself to do everything I conceive of doing.

Still no call back from Dr. Lumos’ office—exasperating and excruciating. What a test of my temper and focus this is. I just want to lie down and sleep, like, all the time, but I decided I should attend a PDBTI class today so I’m doing my best to remain engaged in it and not hate everyone else in the class. Imagine if my family were in town already—would I just cancel all plans with them? What a horrible thought, best to think of other things instead. Like an image of Dr. Lumos sitting in a lawn chair sipping lemonade, distant phone ringing and ringing.

Risky, I know. Past experience has taught me that a day and a night without antidepressants is a recipe for much wackiness. Already the ringing in my ears is quite loud. What’s in store for me tonight, I don’t know, but I know it will be strange.

> Surprisingly, Dr. Lumos had an entirely different story to tell, this afternoon, from what I was told by her assistant earlier this week. Suffice to say she lay the blame entirely at the feet of the pharmacy, and advised me to take certain proactive measures in the future. No comments on the amount of time it took to resolve, but whatever. I did, at least, feel somewhat validated by some of her words and her tone. (If she was being defensive, I couldn’t tell.) A previous version of me would probably be holding onto resentment, but as far as I can tell, I’ve moved on.

The third Nektar lacks the crucial integration features I’d been seeking that the first two have. The fourth synth (M-VAVE 25 V2) also lacks those features, and seems to have an electrical short inside somewhere. Anyway, as you can see I don’t really know what I’m doing here, beyond throwing instruments at a wall and watching to see what sticks. If I could go back in time and do it over, I’d still waffle between the LX 49+ and the LX 25+. The only thing I am sure of is that between them, my needs are probably covered for a good, long while. Assuming the dual stand that I took a chance on today has the right dimensions, that is. I do wish I’d found a way to use the larger Nektar on the couch—it’s a little too long, I think. I’ll be very sad to see the Yamaha go into storage—but I can use the room and it doesn’t integrate with computers well.

The ranger had short hair and was in her twenties, I thought. She took up her bow and stalked off to do the deed while we stood around talking, and I missed most of the action, minus the final death spiral of the male.

>> As a new reality spread through the VR it was up to the audio-video guys to keep everyone sane. Holed up in their support studio, trying to stay on top of things sometimes felt unsustainable. Nevertheless the *precontent* calls and not-so-subtle exploratory forays into the databases indicated that communication with the customers wasn’t entirely unreasonable. They could do this, they knew. Just had to pace themselves and not lose <u>their</u> shit. Their main difficulty, which shouldn’t have been a surprise, proved to be the flood of nuances hitting the translation matrices. So many local ways and means of conveying the emotion that accepting a turn of events—and a new reality—necessitated, the extremes of which often getting missed along the way. But not for good, as every member of the team knew <u>some</u> crazy local jargon that every other member <u>didn’t</u>. Sarcasm, they all managed to agree, was the most challenging, in part because it touched on too many layers of emotion (good and bad). They also all managed to agree that as bad as today was, nothing could be worse than what the story masters were probably facing today.
>> 
>> The reality changes pervaded throughout the realms, and while welcomed by the majority, their impact had subtle implications. The sort of subtlety where the emotional tone can mutate in unexpected ways. Very few members of the story team were privy to all the various permutations, and this was by design—you couldn’t have the full scope of the story changes escape the control of their authors. Still, Alvin watched closely, looking for signs of leaks, so far seeing none. Trying not to become distracted by the power of the story, he strove to remain impartial in his observer role. It wasn’t long before chaos overtook order, and of <u>course</u> it would be a cat who provided the catalyst. Sneaking into a scene from Stage Left, the orange kitty somehow managed to absorb a small branch—no, more of a twig—of one piece of reality, carry it around for a while and then quietly release it into the matrices, where it seemed to disperse but was actually absorbed into the new forks in reality. The shock of the changes created such waves that the poor kitty was propelled backward and out a window, where it hurtled several stories and landed on the ground, turning into a swarm of glowing insects.

Write without thinking, editing, planning, etc. This is supposed to be the sort of writing you want to throw out after, but I say keep all of it. Just do your best to add a little something something to make it at least halfway palatable for later. Stream of consciousness should be possible without necessarily sacrificing readability, I say.

Up until then there was all the usual kinds of expected drama and friction, the kind that brought people together more than anything. I longed to be with her, but I didn’t want to drink and I refused to drink and so we didn’t end up being together in the end, even though it still felt possible, then, at the end. Once I joined the Buffalo Walk I found myself with the missionary family, which consisted of a mother and a bunch of daughters, and I asked them who they had taught that day. They weren’t sure what religion the people they had taught actually were—possibly Mennonite, whatever that was. They also got to swim and play some tennis that day, which they enjoyed.

>> We were all having babies, or rather, our partners were. And we were all staying in one house, which made things interesting. I only recall Pascal and I but there was at least one more couple. We really had our hands full. I passed Pascal on his way out of the house and he was carrying his baby. He had to go to work and for some reason he took his baby with him. I then ventured into the bedroom, where Devin was stirring, and as I picked her up to embrace her in her sleepy state she got older. As she became fully awake I was aware of Rebecca in the next room as Devin whispered in my ear that she had an important secret to share with me. I leaned closer and images flooded through my head. I saw, by her neck, pulsating, an alien organ, pinkish purple in color. She then described how the organ reacted to something and then shook violently. “I had an orgasm,” she told me. This news felt a little strange to hear from my own daughter but at the same time I felt warmed by the sharing and a sense of kinship.
>> 
>> We ventured out and wound up on campus. Wandered into museums and cafeterias, watching people all the time. Twice I spotted and interacted with Spider (Emily Alice Twigg Thewlis), who didn’t recognize who I was but knew there was something funny going on. She also looked different, to me, almost like she was a different person but not quite. On both occasions she asked me, by way of a written sign appearing on her torso, if I played the game. Her asking was not consciously intended, I knew—it came from a place of intense curiosity and wondering. She was dying to know where she knew me from. I toyed with her by not answering, or even replying at all, and I followed her for a bit, practically taunting her.

>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20250313-p02.png|400]]
>> 
>> We soon found ourselves in a manor—whose it was I didn’t know—and she proceeded to confront me physically, almost violently. We wrestled, me mostly on defense, and she caused me some sort of unspecified injury.
>> 
>> The dream starts to fade a bit at this point but Devin and I were back on campus. She soon grew sick, and I was in pain, and we eventually found ourselves in a Catholic children’s hospital, where she vomited in the lobby, which got the nurses’ attention immediately. One nurse went to do a blood test and in a panic, while her attention was diverted, I grabbed the microscope slide and smashed it to the ground, as I wanted to protect Devin’s secret alien genes. I stood looking down at the pieces of glass on the ground, only feeling slightly guilty.
>> 
>> Very soon after this, I experienced a sharp pain on my left side and brought this to the attention of the nursing staff. They immediately identified the source of the pain: it was one of my left ribs. And now the remaining parts of the dream fade.

My favorite moment was Shawntel quoting from David Lynch’s “Catching the Big Fish”—she remembered how heartbroken we both were when he passed. Now I must move forward and continue the work. Going to be interesting to watch how effective I am at using the plan documents I created, and the Daily Schedule.

Spent an hour tracing an old photograph of me in Ethiopia (or maybe Eritrea), then worked on some KFJC station IDs. Fun morning so far.

>> The bicycle might not have been the best choice for transportation, looking back, but it was the only choice we had. I taught school each day and needed to somehow transport my baby daughter, young son, and my mother all to school each morning. The turning point happened when the bicycle fell over onto its side in the middle of the road one morning. There was nothing we could do to get it going again, but I tried. Unfortunately my passengers were not feeling cooperative and refused to move from their positions, or help me to right the thing. I found myself yelling at my mother to shut up, as she kept providing unsolicited input.
>> 
>> I dropped the bike off at the police station for repairs, locking it up on a rack outside. I then went to school, where instead of teaching I was distracted by the needs of my children all day. When I returned to the station, I saw that they had begun to forcibly remove all the bicycles. They ticketed me for taking advantage of their rack all day, and refused to agree to repairs, laughing at me, even after I explained that this was where I worked at night.

And this person was at risk, so I had to run through all the required steps.

>> In this dream Devin, Akif and Minha lived in a small apartment located in a multicomplex comprised of apartments, shops, and a train station. When I arrived Akif greeted me and informed me that Devin and Minha were still asleep, and had been fighting a cold recently. I greeted Akif in return with a “As-salamo alaykum,” which surprised him. He had a friend over, and we also exchanged greetings. She was less surprised by my greeting and greeted me similarly in return.
>> 
>> Since Devin and Minha were still asleep I ventured out into the complex, and soon found myself deep within its bowels, closer to all the train activity. On the way there I found myself in conversation with an old man who was grateful to have company on his ritual walk home. We arrived at his apartment and he let his hair down, and indicated that he would be fine now and wanted to go about his day. I left him, and as I continued through the complex I encountered two more old men who stood conversing in a corridor, almost in whispers, about someone who had apparently been committing atrocities. One of the old men really caught my attention and I observed that he must have been quite a specimen when still in his prime. As I continued to explore, this man was conversing with yet another old man. “First thing we have to do,” I heard him say, “is find out what that monster is *doing*. ”

>> I wandered back up through the complex to Devin’s apartment and when I walked in, Devin and Minha were waking up at last. Akif called out to Devin and asked her if she needed anything and, stirring in her cot, Devin responded, “Coconut milk.” She then stood and exited the bedroom, proceeding to the kitchen to assist Akif with Thanksgiving preparation.
>> 
>> Soon, Minha was up as well, and she came stumbling out, looking cute, only to be scooped up by a young neighbor boy who had a facial disfiguration. He escorted Minha to the bathroom.
>> 
>> A short while later Devin and I wandered over to a Good Will store in the multiplex, where we found that the majority of items were pots and pans, and sleeping bags. In one aisle a man was delighted to find what he decided to call a “Thanksgiving tree.” He shook it and a bunch of fake needles fell off. Feeling done with the place, Devin and I began to wander out but we soon found ourselves caught up in a very long and dense line and it took forever to leave.

>> The only remaining part of the dream that I can recall now featured Ed Schultz and his dad, Bud Schultz, and somehow involved a car, and their German heritage.

>> Dream: When I was a kid, my dad and I played this little game (usually at bedtime) where I would use an activating word, “Narf,” which would trigger my dad into action. He would then launch himself at my neck, saying, “Narf, narf, narf,” while burrowing in and tickling me with his nose. In this dream I related the experience while out to dinner with my companion, mentioning a memory of my dad’s unshaven cheek scratching my face and neck in the process. She reacted to the unshavenness with surprise; she felt it was inconsiderate of him. I reminded her that this was the 1970s. I then related an episode from a 1980s sitcom involving a cop protagonist. My companion secretly tried to recover this episode and present it as a gift, but this somehow backfired in a humorous way.

>> Somehow I was completely unsurprised when my female companion began to oscillate between female researcher and my uncle, at which point I participated in a ritual intended for children and their parents. As we proceeded down a corridor, we discussed our preferred biomes. His was a beach and mine was a grassy knoll, which I explained was adjacent to the forest, jungle, dirt, and rock biomes, much to his delight. I then proceeded to carry her (in her researcher form) on my back as she conducted research in a large lake.
>> 
>> To better protect her, I gathered a pile of dry leaves, which she was instructed to place around her groin area so as to reduce the chances of detection by bears in the nearby jungle biome. She had a research grant with the nearby University of Australia for the study of bears in their natural habitat. These bears were known to kidnap human women and force them to prepare the bear nest and mother the cubs. When they had kidnapped the researcher she had been trapped in a nest for weeks, and the nest even had snakes. She eventually managed to escape and avoided a grisly demise (the bears ate the women in the end). She went on to film an extensive documentary.
>> 
>> Soon, Cheryl and Dan came to visit me. I hadn’t lived in Australia for very long and I was still trying to adapt to the astronomical differences, which were wreaking havoc on my body and mind. The rotation of the planet was significantly shorter where I had come from, and my mother didn’t appear to understand or, perhaps, even recognize my predicament. Cheryl and Dan related that they had recently traveled to China, where the astronomical differences impacted my mother similarly. On one day trip she had attempted to kayak out on the water but the water had changed to grape jelly. A local man, shutting his windows, refused to recognize her predicament even though he lived in a lighthouse right on the water.
>> 
>> Cheryl and Dan soon took me out to a movie, and reacted judgmentally when I walked with a pronounced limp in my right leg. We got coffee and ice cream, and I went to eat my ice cream in private, where a woman described her dog, who enjoyed watching the path of the two suns. Then there was an announcement on TV that Gesso had been found. I was profoundly happy when we were reunited, but he wanted to be reunited with his favorite dog friend. I allowed him to gnaw on my hand, for comfort, and he soon grew calm and relaxed.

He had corrupted the ear of a well-connected politician by feeding him fake financial data, the downstream effects of which being that the politician (or another one) publicly insulted the leader of Yemen. An additional consequence was an intense escalation in aggression on the part of the Trump Administration over the course of several months. We were now on the verge of war with the Middle East, and were expecting a missile strike from Yemen at any moment.

>> Some guy created a simulated world that he unimaginatively dubbed “Online” that was running on a monitor he kept in his house. David Cropsey was showing it to me and complaining that the name was misleading, as the simulation was often unavailable. We could see the guy peeking out at us through a curtain in his house, so we knew he could hear David’s criticism, and yet he refused to change anything.
>> 
>> We went into the game and explored it a bit. It was *vast*. The facilitator (my waking name for him) would periodically enter the world himself to observe the players.
>> 
>> Over time, the simulation evolved and eventually became indistinguishable from reality, for those who were in it. In fact, its inhabitants gradually became pulled into it via a strange “liquid human” process whereby people were injected into their projection counterparts, unwillingly I believe.
>> 
>> The Facilitator had a habit of turning invisible so that he could observe the participants up close. He would wear a special suit that had all sorts of bells and whistles, looked down on the world from up high, and then dive in. He roamed around, watching people. From a bird’s eye view perspective, the simulation was ovular and resembled a sports stadium.
>> 
>> As the simulation evolved it moved into space and became a gigantic vessel, surrounded by a fleet. There were many facilitators now, all competing in some fashion, with our main facilitator still playing the role of observer in the simulation. Participants in the sim were now essentially captured and mindwiped, and then as mentioned above, imported physically. One day a skeevy man visited the facilitator and offered a way to spice things up. Before he could be stopped he inserted a chip into the main terminal that wrote algorithms into a few specific participants, and as it overwrote their personalities and appearance it flashed “rape” and “wished for rape” lighted messages, the implication being that the process was so horrendous that it felt equivalent to rape, and/or that participants would prefer it over what they were being put through, or something.
>>

>> 
>> It was at this point that these participants (or “guests” as I think they might have been called) were transformed from projections to fully imported people. These changes troubled the facilitators, who scrambled to mitigate the unwanted effects. The simulation underwent alterations, with Hell being removed. One last thing that I remember: the skeevy visitor was later presented in an illustrated children’s book and had a cartoonish appearance.

(Primitive dwellings used on land before homes were built.) Useful info and spawned another research task. Useful because dugouts are mentioned several times in the Banister Tapes.

>> [!dream-diary] Correction [[Journals/Dream Diary/Dream Diary#^20250406-correction|Dream Diary]]
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20250406.png|400]]
>> 
>> We were exploring the grounds of an abandoned estate when Shaggy and Scooby began a game of duplicating themselves. This was distracting me and while I was off guard Aaron Marks suddenly burst into a room and attempted to knock me out and kidnap me, intending to send me back in time to correct a mistake. We had gone through many such cycles before, apparently, and nothing had worked so far. This kidnapping was an innovation and was the last attempt.
>> 
>> Despite the beatdown he gave me he was unsuccessful at knocking me unconscious, and as I regained my bearings I began to fight back. I first grabbed a broom, but he was able to disarm me right away. Then I found a metal soup spoon and tried to knock him on the head a few times, but I was still too weak to be effective, and he got the spoon away from me. Finally, as I began to grow tired Aaron got the better of me and performed his magic to send me back in time.
>> 
>> I was supposed to make a correction but I didn’t know what it was. I met up with some heroes who were on their way somewhere, and along the way I acquired a magical sword in which lived a sprite named Ed, and we fell in love. Ed had three forms while outside the sword: glowing green ball that floated in the air, and two beautiful female shapes. I loved her more than anything. When in sword form she shimmered with a blue-gray glow. We took to space with the other heroes and had a countless number of space adventures. We soon grew battle fatigued, bitter, and hard, with me being the most cynical of the bunch.
>> 
>> It was after we teamed up with a crew of alien contract warriors when the shit hit the fan. I was out on a docked ship, drinking with some crew members when I glanced over and noticed the green slime that was slithering and dripping its way out of a treasure hoard in a cargo hold on the mothership.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20250406-p02.png|400]]
>> 
>> I knew that the slime was connected to a demon who had been captured and trapped inside a jewel on a priceless ring. I pointed at the slime and informed my crew buddies, and we took turns taking pot shots at it with arrows. Soon, a few of the contract warriors emerged from the mothership, saw what we were doing, and began shooting arrows themselves. As more contract warriors joined, some began to panic and shoot other warriors by mistake, which led to an all out fight. All the warriors were now fighting each other and wiping themselves out. Their master was very displeased. I wanted to tell the master about the demon in the ring and how important it was to close up the hold, but there were too many other things happening to make this possible. I’m not certain but I suppose this fight might have been the event that needed undoing. There was another event that took place in a cavern that involved Ed, but my memory of that dream segment has sadly faded.
>> 
>> Later, the whole crew, the remaining warriors, the master, my hero friends and I found ourselves on a commercial plane bound for San Francisco. The master was piloting, or at least was by the time we had to land, and despite my pointing out the runways he decided to land on a city street instead, causing the plane to catch fire.

>> Ben and I were out for drinks, where I was to bring him up to speed on things in my life and explain this philosophy I had about, if I can recall correctly, discouragements and encouragements. Before we got into the subject I was not feeling well and cancelled on the conversation, much to the disappointment of Ben and everyone in the bar who had also been looking forward to the discussion.
>> 
>> Later, I was on my way home when Rebecca stopped and picked me up. While driving toward my house she made a number of lewd expressions and kept trying to put my fingers into her mouth. She was drunk, and I got fed up and exited the car, intending to just walk home instead.
>> 
>> While walking home, I called Ben and complained about Rebecca’s odd behavior. When I arrived, he came over, bringing a friend with him. They were having an affair, he explained while standing in my foyer. When she entered a moment later I tried to approach the subject of discouragements and encouragements again, but she didn’t seem particularly interested in anything I had to say. Ben was feeling tired and lay on the couch. The friend soon let in a neighbor who needed to use my bathroom. Because it was located on the third floor I had to bust out a winch that was shaped like a large fish hook (no barbs) and set it up. The neighbor was slightly put off but was mostly a good sport, and obediently got onto the winch and allowed me to send her upstairs.
>> 
>> At some point during the dream (unsure of when) Ben brought me to his house to see his brother and mother. His brother was elusive and only allowed us glimpses of himself through a reflection on a large photograph. Chana, his mother, was doing well and in fact looked thirty years younger. She was pleased when I told her this.

>> In a basement somewhere, a pervy man comes onto a woman. She leans forward and whispers that under no circumstances will she ever consider being with him.
>> 
>> In a small town, a sheriff and two deputies prepare to begin a raid on an old house. Inside live an old couple, both evil. The sheriff hands a revolver, two grenades, and a rifle to the junior deputy and instructs him to do his best. If the shit really hits the fan, he says, just toss the grenade into a room and close the door after it.
>> 
>> The three proceed upstairs, where they find the old couple. The woman is gibbering on the ground, seemingly in great mental and physical pain. They take them into custody but while loading them into patrol vehicles a crew of nasty, evil men show up to rescue the couple. I am now the deputy, and I am inside one of the patrol cars when someone approaches, reaching towards the door just as I am closing it. I go ahead and close it anyway on his finger, then realize that it was the neighbor and not one of the evil men. His finger is blue now and nearly flat. The old couple manage to make it back to the house and go upstairs.
>> 
>> The next segment is muddled but there is more pursuit of the old woman in various locations. I keep trying to use the grenade as instructed but can’t ever seem to do it correctly.
>> 
>> We finally find ourselves in a different part of town, where I’m now pursuing other men who are associated with the old couple. I throw a grenade at one, and it bounces around the porch and doesn’t explode. When the man climbs into a car I finally manage to use the grenade correctly, but it has no effect on him.

>> Dreamt that I was helping a kid escape his megalomaniac father from a compound, and that at some point I became the escapee. Had to keep my face from being visible by averting it the best I could. Later I was paying a visit to Lynne Egli at his home (where he was possibly the butler instead), and was eating a trail of chocolates that led up to the door. The trail ran out before I got to it and I turned to a woman who I knew and asked her if she’d spotted any more. She had not, and I proceeded to knock at the door. While I waited the woman said she had to go, and left her kid there on the step. I said, “no worries, I’ll watch your kid,” but the woman was already gone. Lynne then let me in and offered me a drink of whiskey, which I accepted.

>> We had Ed and Elaine over for a visit and they were helping us sort through our things and work out what was owned by Rebecca and what belonged to me. At one point someone had the idea to shellac some pottery down so that it didn’t fly off a shelf during a thunderstorm. Immediately I found myself on a rope and flying through the air in the house, and I tested to see if I could budge the pottery—I couldn’t.
>> 
>> I then went for a “walk” through the neighborhood with my rope. Before I could do anything stupid Ed invited us all out to Frank & Joe’s for hamburgers at the mall. The line was long—like literally a mile long—but we were nonplussed. We got our burgers and returned to the car.
>> 
>> On the way back to the house I found myself separated from the group, and somewhat lost. Soon I was in another car and I made the mistake of passing a man on a motorcycle. He did not appreciate this and gestured that I come back to talk with him, and then explained to me the etiquette of passing motorcycles. Later I was driving his motorcycle and decided to return it. When I wandered into the motorcycle club to do so, he bullied me.
>> 
>> I’m not sure how it connects, but in time I found myself using the rope again. This time the other end of it was attached to a car being driven by a good friend. The friend was not paying close attention to the effects of his driving, as I zig-zagged on the freeway due to his erratic lane changes. At several points I almost went flying off the side. We soon exited the freeway and he performed this ridiculous right turn that really sent me flying, and I found myself going under a large semi truck. I was not pleased and when I found my feet I scolded him as he browsed a local gallery.

>> Here’s the summary from our visit:  
>>   
>> Structure to try this week for video game moderation: Set a pop-up timer to track play time. Aim to stay at or below 2 hours per day.  
>> -Benefits of moderation: Creating more time and space to be effective towards goals, feel like you’re conforming to your values better.  
>> -Drawbacks of not using moderation: Feeling disappointed in self for not acting consistently with values, risk of not getting goals done (short and long term).  
>>   
>> Alternative ways to cope with uncertainty or feeling stuck:  
>> -Write down intent while journaling, “I would like to be doing `___`.”  
>> -STOP skill.  
>> -Urge-surfing.  
>> -Pros and cons.  
>>   
>> Consider attending a resume review workshop at [Multnomah County](https://multcolib.org/job-career-help)

>> The furthest back that I can remember of the dream, we were all bunked up together in a dormitory of some kind. I awoke before everyone else, fumbled for the bong in my bed, and took a little sip before I realized what I was doing. Spat out the water and got up, looking around at all my sleeping friends.
>> 
>> A little later we were at a fancy ceremony, where everyone was camped out on a big lawn. I had chosen to camp near the projector, for some reason. It was a backwards projector, and everyone was looking my way. I soon grew very hot, and had to remove my sweatshirt in front of everyone.
>> 
>> In time, I was camping out on a little island that was in the vicinity. Gradually, the space I was in was filled up by myself and four other guys. Lying down, I was so wedged in that I couldn’t budge without bumping someone, so I proposed that we leave our skinny little island.
>> 
>> Soon we were racing across a lagoon and something happened to our boat, causing it to break down. A captain came by then and rescued us. She took us to a mechanic. She felt a little intimidated and was reluctant to go in until she could apply more grease to her face. We went in and she located a can of special oil that we would need for the boat repairs. She handed the can to the cashier, indicated that we would foot the bill, and left the shop.
>> 
>>> [!journal-page|right]
>>> ![[banister-journals-20250413-p03.png|400]]
>> 
>> I went up to the cashier to pay and he said that it came to 80. I tossed him 80¢ and he told me, “No, dollars”. I was shocked, as this would drain my finances significantly. I paid anyway.
>> 
>> We got back to the boat and even though I was mad, the captain and I joked around about what $80 would do for boat upgrades. We would enlarge the boat and add other features, including a waterbed. All boats should have waterbeds, we joked.
>> 
>> The scene shifted and we were not boarding a plane. I was still ruminating on my lost $80 when I saw my uncle Rick on the plane. We hugged and I told him that he looked great, and neither of us felt that the sentiment was truthful. My dad was also on the plane. He pulled out his wallet at one point and said that he had $300,000 (in cashiers checks) in it, much to the embarrassment of everybody. Nora teased him. Then my dad said, apropos of nothing, “I’ll fill out any check you like, but I won’t sign.”
>> 
>> We arrived at a big banquet hosted by Maxwell, who had also hosted everything else. My friend James Cropsey was with me as my personal guest. I showed him the tree fort (see [[2025#^20250411|April 11]]), but he had already seen it. I was about to sit down to eat when I noticed how gross the food looked. Maxwell, someone pointed out, tended to be cheap. I didn’t bother eating and returned to Jim, who was engaging in public displays of affection with his girlfriend. I warned him that this was not ideal behavior for this setting. Soon, people began to toss a white, food-covered tablecloth back and forth. Then I ran into Ali Allie, who was wearing a green screen shirt and had long blonde hair.

>> Dreamt that I was asked to process a new cadaver while vacationing at the beach. The body was dropped off unceremoniously—almost placed on one of our blankets, but I protested and the delivery woman slid it over and onto the sand. I took a minute to converse with her before she left, thanking her and expressing my appreciation. Then I turned my attention to the body. He was in his thirties and seemingly in decent shape. No info on cause of death.
>> 
>> We picked up the body and put it on the space truck. (We didn’t call it that, but I am now.) The organs would need to be removed and then put it in the mail. For some reason, I was distracted and forgot to put it into refrigeration. For this reason, the body was at serious risk of being no longer usable. I quickly got to work and started on the liver. There was no blood, and I wrapped it up and boxed it. Then I moved onto the pancreas, and did the same. Someone noticed that the organs weren’t properly boxed up and chided me for it. And here the dream begins to fade.

>> In another segment I was at some sort of school, doing homework (or studying, not sure) near Andalib Kelghati, who kept glancing my way, making sure that I wasn’t goofing off.
>> 
>> Another segment featured farmland with many cats who had parachuted down to reach the location. Their little parachutes were cute. Near the end of the dream I spotted Uncle Man eating a bug that flew into his mouth.

Mildly traumatic, I’m guessing, as it is still for me sometimes.

>> My companion was a firefox who sat in a backpack on my back. When he spread his wings we flew together, but something had gone wrong with the bonding and we needed more time together. When not on my back he lived in a box that was attached to the side of the house. I’d had to get special permission from the school for the backpack, as well as help from my mentor for the bullies.
>> 
>> We lived on a farm with a bunch of kids. Toys were strewn everywhere on the floor. Most had a component consisting of a ziplock bag containing blue gel. Most, also, were forgotten. Raj Bobo was there as a baby, lying on his back, blinking, having just awoken. Many people arriving at the farm brought exotic animals with them, e.g. jaguars and pythons, much to my dismay.
>> 
>> Soon, a show and tell was planned at school and I solicited help from my mother and <span style="font-size:.25em;">Cindy</span>. My mother volunteered to wrangle a python. Soon, also, it was time to brush our teeth, and I used a combo of an electric toothbrush and a child’s normal toothbrush, which I tried to conceal from others.
>> 
>> Elsewhere, I encountered an unhoused man who, at the camp where he lived, constructed a makeshift prison. He demonstrated its effectiveness to me by rapping on the bars of a cage. At a barbeque men prepared a large pig and while removing and displaying organs, it was evident that pig anus was valued the most.

>> Nearby, on the coast, a witch ran a haunted pig anus shop. Its most recent surrogate owners had fled because of the haunting. Greg Brown and I infiltrated the shop as new surrogates, and we brought pig anus with us, already prepared. We were to sell unusual shirts on the side of the highway.

>> Aaron Marks was an alcohol virgin and his father and I set out to rectify that. He, in fact, volunteered us for the job because he looked up to us.
>> 
>> For some reason we figured champagne would be a fine choice and soon we had a bottle of it, but when we tried to pop the cork something went wrong and we lost a third of the bottle. We did some math. Two thirds of a bottle would still keep Aaron toasted through the night. So he got to drinking (didn’t like the taste of champagne) and we worked on other projects (I don’t recall what).
>> 
>> When we returned to Aaron he was reclining out by a muddy puddle in the back yard. He didn’t seem any drunker. I approached the pond and picked up a glass Dan had left there, and Aaron invited me to drink it. It tasted foul and Aaron informed me that it wasn’t tequila left by Dan, but in fact had been sitting out in the yard for the better part of a year.
>> 
>> I then noticed that a tadpole had crawled up my shirt and was trying to get into my pants. As I fought to get it out, I sat down at the edge of the puddle and put my feet in the water, which was full of squirmy things.
>> 
>> Later, after reading about a certain corporation, I set out to rectify my unemployment situation by paying them a visit. Upon arrival I immediately set out to explore the building. There wasn’t much that interested me, so I left.
>> 
>> I returned on another day with Rebecca and was wearing a required tweed suit jacket, as were some other guys I was with in the elevator. Unlike them, I had nothing on underneath.

>> Rebecca has gotten a job at a mega corporation. Doing what, I have no idea. We are no longer together as a couple but we remain good friends. She tries to introduce me to other women from her workplace and two women seem to have taken a shine to me, so we hang out together and talk.
>> 
>> One day, Rebecca begins to flirt with me. This makes me uncomfortable and I protest, but she seems to be incapable of stopping. Then at some point she decides to “attribute” her new baby to the twin brother of the father, and reacts stubbornly and cryptically when I share my concerns with her.
>>  
>>  At home later, I am bored and decide to check out an old game which I’d never played called Stronghold. The animated game cover art features two men, one blonde, both bearded, peering suspiciously out of a tower, and then shrugging.
>>  
>>  In the game, as shown from a first person perspective, I roll out a small catapult into a courtyard and begin hurtling rocks at the roof of the tower. Each hit causes a noticeable amount of damage and I am instructed by a disembodied voice to target a specific weak spot. This is too easy, I think to myself, and I wonder when men with axes are going to show up to defend the place.
>>  
>>  Then the woman who lives in the hovel I’m visiting brings her boy out into the yard with me and tells him to stay with me while she goes to town, and he stands in a spot that’s almost right in front of me. As I hold my breath while taking the next shot, just as I let loose the boulder the boy shifts his weight and bumps into me, ruining my shot. Then a baby cries, and I realize that this must be the true challenges that players must face.
>>  
>>> [!journal-page|right]

>>  
>>  At the mega corp I ask a dude if he liked games and if so, had he ever played Stronghold. He responds in the affirmative, laughing.
>>  
>>  Rebecca borrows his Trans Am and is disgusted by all the rotting garbage in the front seat, and proceeds to clean one seat. This soon becomes a group effort.
>>  
>>  Back at the mega corp, I chat with one of the women I’d been hanging out with about the corporation’s history, and when I compare it to a shark she reacts with a scolding tone. “I would say it’s more like a dragon or a dolphin,” she says, and we both agree that dolphins are jerks.

>> A large number of mostly teenagers were visiting and staying at my family home, spread across two buildings. Some were local—friends of my step siblings—and some were from Europe or Russia.
>> 
>> My daughter was also staying there, along with her family, which included three babies, a toddler girl and two baby boys. One of the boys demonstrated a voracious appetite and I watched him take enormous bites out of a sandwich someone had given him. Cats and kittens were running about chasing fruits and vegetables someone had set down as toys.
>> 
>> One evening my step sister was going out for the evening, and I was responsible for sitting up while she was gone and making sure she was safe. As she was leaving she asked me what I would do with myself, and whether I would get ale like last time. I was embarrassed, but we both knew that I hadn’t actually gotten any because I was still sober.
>> 
>> I believe it was that evening when Tim Bockmiller came over. I was so preoccupied with something that we didn’t get a chance to hang out, but I scrambled to get ready to do so before he left. While using the bathroom, I feel into the bathtub while fully dressed, which delayed me further. Finally I went and spoke with Tim just as he was preparing to head out with some friends, and he showed me a retro video game he had been playing in which the female protagonist had wings and fought a dragon with a pike.
>> 
>> Apropos of nothing, elsewhere in the world a statue of a god that was the size of a mountain came crashing down, falling on a smaller statue of a lesser deity, as well as onto an indestructible building.

A well regarded rebel standing outside his tent throwing boulders at the regime, everyone else worrying that he could be taken into custody at any moment.

Standing at it, I watched the dreams play as I manipulated its intricate controls. I knew exactly what I was doing and yet at the observation layer I didn’t know what the me whose point of view I was sharing knew, necessarily, so I can’t really say what the console did even though I was working at it all night.
>> 
>> Sometimes my work at the console had visible effects on the events that were playing out around me, but this seemed rare, or at least it was subtle enough that the observer me wasn’t picking up on it.
>> 
>> The first story to play for me took place at a water-themed theme park and featured my family and I progressing through different areas together, starting at the top, where staff welcomed us with a musical routine. The rest of the story is lost to me but I remember a long segment where we were underwater and swam with our shark friends, some of whom we would help don foam armor. Another long story featured Dr. Doug from KFJC, but I forget most of it now.

What does reflecting on it bring up for me now? Where was the friction coming from? A good question, because it is probably notable and unusual for a four-year-old boy to be fighting with his father on a regular basis.

> What was the next highlighted event? Moving to Istanbul? Is that worth looking at in the context of identifying and fleshing out a narrative? Probably not. Moving on. Next: My mother and father arguing, seeing how she glowed upon returning to Cathy’s cabin after having been with Dan in Berkeley for a couple of days. (They didn’t have an affair, my mother told me a few months back. At least, not a physical one. Instead, she had discovered what it felt like to be fully accepted and appreciated by a man she liked to spend time with.)
> 
> I can still see them in my mind: she and Dan crossing a creek, smiling and laughing. My father visibly upset about something, enough so to go storming off by himself. What was he feeling, and why? No, that isn’t germane. That’s *his* story, not mine. There, see, I bet I’m avoiding the thing I’m supposed to be looking at. Her sudden happiness, his anger, these were the things. Neither had anything to do with me, I must have known. And yet, they affected me deeply.
> 
> Her happiness in that moment, her love, its source had no direct connection to me; she wasn’t getting it from any well I had access to. Whereas when I call to mind photos I don’t have anymore—that I think my mother lost, in fact—of their wedding, of them doing the feeding cake to one another thing, *that* is a well I can tap. By contrast, when I recall the look on my father’s face as he went off alone (what was it, dejectedness? Betrayal?) that must connect to the same wellspring, and it poisons it.

We were a family of redheads, and we had located a planet that was years away from Earth, and had the means to get there. Somehow I and several other babies had been “lost” for some time. The government cracked down on the family before the plan could be executed and threw the majority of the adults into prison. I met with one of the elders just before he was finally released, and he pointed a finger at something and said words that I do not remember.

When Roger was murdered, all sorts of cascading effects were kicked off, but I was nine years old and probably unaware of most of that. Its significance was, I believe, that it heralded a series of destructive events whose effects *would* impact me in ways that I would be aware of. But when Roger died, I remember only sadness, confusion, and empathy for my father and his parents/sister. In a way, I was still safe in the eye of the storm.

> When my mother’s mother, Crystaline, began her fight with cancer, I seem to remember a sense of dread, but this could be me retroactively inserting that feeling. I’m going to assume that this is the case. But I am somewhat more certain that this dread did manifest at some point during the course of her illness, as the effects of the losing battle were probably hard—even for an 11-year-old—to miss.

Dirty, disheveled, and wary, she nevertheless accepted the pizza that I brought her. I was to give her a choice between one and a half cooked or leave the second half pie uncooked (this would produce more, later) but she was already devouring the cooked portion so I left it alone. However, she sensed the question anyway and reacted angrily. She stank.

>> While floating through town I spotted Cat in his human form, sitting in a parked car and getting a blow job. Female Cat was with him. As I watched I saw them exit the car, transform into their cat forms, and begin to slowly climb the wall of a house where a local girl lived. This was what I feared would happen. They ascended in a way that looked supernatural. Through the windows of the house I could see the outlines of another girl, in her bedroom, and her father, downstairs. When Cat and Girl Cat reached the roof Cat began singing to the younger girl through the window, but in such a way that only we who were present could hear. I confronted Cat, and he and Girl Cat ran away. The young girl’s father then came to the window and I realized that he must have overheard everything and was now speculating on the significance.
>> 
>> Cat was hanging out at a party when I finally found them next, and I approached him again. This time he didn’t run away, but he was wary. “Don’t worry,” I said. “I just need to know, why?” I asked them. He shook his head, no. “I must know. Please.” She joined him when he shook his head again. “Please, I beg of you.” He then turned to me. “And I beg of you, why do you ask?” Suddenly everything went black for a moment, and when the world returned, my ex-lover, Alex, stood before me. She took me aside and said, “This is Robert.” She was excited and informed me that Robert and I that we had been kissing. He shifted his feet, presumably embarrassed. She then took my face and began kissing me, but I stopped her because I felt she had misunderstood the situation.

>> The veil parts at the point where  Ramadas had to arrest Gracie and Mindy was asked to change offices for publicity reasons. I have no idea what Gracie did or why she was arrested.
>> 
>> I’d just been hired by an up and coming tech company, and Devin drove me to work on my first day. When we got to my new office there was no power or working phone. Devin went to go say hi to a friend she knew there, and while I was walking around I was called over to the conference room. I got to the door, which was partially blocked, and poked my head in. Cynthia spotted to me and gestured that I should enter.
>> 
>> I went in and greeted everyone. I was aware that I wasn’t feeling well—perhaps hungover or sick. I may or may not have been wearing a shirt. Seeing nowhere better, I sat awkwardly on the floor as the presentation began, feeling the intense stares coming from everybody in the room. When the lights came on again, everybody was still looking at me. Somebody then asked me how familiar I was with Flow, as my skills were needed in that area. I answered in the positive. They then went on some more about Flow and how they envisioned it, at which point  Ramadas walked over and informed the room that I would be wonderful.
>> 
>> I noticed that he was touching me a lot and making odd eye contact. I leaned over to his ear and whispered that since I couldn’t hear the others, maybe I could use his ear to amplify the sound. I then asked the room if Bruce or Bill were familiar with Flow. I wasn’t sure who these men were; had just heard the names. Bruce, a short man with curly hair and unforgettably floppy ears, stepped forward and admitted that he didn’t know much.

>> 
>>  Ramadas then took me over to a bulletin board where he gestured at a sheet of paper. “This is what we’ll need you to reflow,” he said, and as I examined it more closely it suddenly dawned on me what the hell Flow was. It was sheet music that needed freshening. “Keep it in the same key and try to stick with the same chords,”  Ramadas suggested. Even though my skills in music were limited, this, I felt, I could do. I turned to Cynthia who was sitting behind a counter and asked her when they expected to review my changes. “Let me check those dates for you,” she replied.

>> When I arrived at work my bike was broken, but I locked it up anyway and went in. Tom Newsom was there, or rather a guy who was a lot like him. We discussed an issue with a phone at great length while out on a walk through campus.
>> 
>> I had a problem. At night, Rebecca kept paying me visits that were making me very uncomfortable, in that she would climb into bed with me and try to make love. I finally had enough and went to Lucas Belsmith for mediation help. Lucas spent a lot of time listening to us explain our respective points of view, but I was holding something back. I finally took him aside and, making sure she was out of ear shot, I confessed that I found her to be repugnant. He was taken aback, but resumed his assistance with new enthusiasm, revealing himself as a top-notch mediator indeed.
>> 
>> Back at school, I had a problem that was so important to me that I started a formal protest to get more attention on it. It worked, but perhaps even better than I’d hoped because professors and students from all over were approaching me about it. Soon I learned that I had received an invitation from a prestigious Danish university. It was a scholarship, in fact. Tom pointed out that this university was a sister to ours, a relationship which posed all sorts of advantages. I began to prepare myself for the transition.
>> 
>> Then I received a package from the Danish university which contained a set of Dragonborn staves. I looked at them in turn, intending to make a choice between the elements, when my parents showed up and began to harass me about my choices. “Did you even *try* to go?” my father asked me. I wasn’t sure what he was referring to.

>> Then my mother yanked at my shirt, exposing my chest and arms, and did the same to her own shirt. I turned to another guy in the cafeteria we were in, and mocked the action of ripping my shirt off, which made him laugh.
>> 
>> Later, there was a murder at my house, and we needed to set out to prove that we didn’t do it, and demonstrate who did, and how. We meticulously recorded each step along the way, culminating in a climactic finish of burning grass. A white horse stood by, watching silently. The smoke from the fire was bad news. Rebecca lived next door in a large boot house, and I’d taken pains to draw the property lines around and between both houses. She repeated our actions, but something went wrong when she burned the grass, and the white cloud of smoke drew unwanted attention from something, somewhere.

Midnight through 6am.” I eventually made an appearance and introduced myself to a lady wearing a sun hat, who introduced me to everyone else at the picnic table where we sat. And indeed, we were there all night.
>> 
>> Frank left the bar and got into his car. Soon, he pulled out and followed another car a ways until it entered an alley way, where it paused. Frank held the steering wheel tightly as he watched a woman exit her car and approach a man who was waiting by another car. Her father. Frank has taken another Frank’s identity.
>> 
>> The woman volunteers for a suicide mission. In case of capture she is to hide her religion and certain objects in her underclothes.
>> 
>> Soon, I show up for a meeting with three people, where I am told that I have been bumped up from Rank 3.5 to 5, and have been chosen to lead. I accept, but I worry about doing a good job. Nevertheless, I return to the Sun-Kissed Bar, where I meet with Frank and company. We do business, but we also eat a lot of food and get hammered.
>> 
>> I am out walking my orange cat, ruminating on leadership, when I spy some leashed dogs up ahead. I take a different fork on the path in order to avoid them.
>> 
>> Actors on a movie set. One is named Frank, but he is a different Frank. He showers with his stunt double who also refers to himself as Frank, although the likelihood of this being true seems slim.
>>

I am wanting to implement at least some of these, but will have to work out how to do so in a way that makes it easy to use the data.

> Added the above metrics (or at the very least, placeholders for them) to my [[2024]] and current 2025 journals, to the bottom of each dream diary entry. I haven’t tested it yet but I believe I’ve made it relatively easy to capture the data later, when I set out to tally the numbers up, while also making it easy on the eyes while browsing. I also spent a significant part of the afternoon writing a utility that counts the number of words highlighted, so that I can more easily capture Journal entry or Dream Diary entry word counts. Without this, I was resorting to other tools that either counted things I didn’t want counted or didn’t work well in other ways. I might create a plugin with similar functionality for Obsidian. (Would look good on the resume.)

We were all naked, in fact, and as we rode we kept time with the whips, singing: “Ride that horse, slap that ass, but only from the left.” As I leaned into the whipping, a smile crept over the erstwhile sergeant’s face, though he stared ahead: he approved.

If I awaken at any time during the night I jot down a kind of outline, or at least rough notes, without lingering on descriptions. Then when I can remember no more, if it is not too close to morning I go back to sleep. Repeat process through the night until I get up.

>> 
>> One day I was at work in our local department store—a place that was akin to Fred Meyer—and I was in a grumpy mood, in part because beetles had infested my couch at home and were munching on my candy. Andy approached me at one point and asked me to watch him as he demonstrated a new prank he had devised. While Phil wasn’t looking, Andy swapped Phil’s hard drive with one that had almost no extra space on it, causing Phil’s computer to crash. Phil was understandably very upset by this, and we played innocent for a while before finally confessing to the deed and explaining that it was actually harmless.
>> 
>> I soon found myself feeling quite bored while browsing for punk clothes in the store. I was waiting for Aaron Hooker to finally be ready to hang out, and he was taking a ridiculously long (I thought) shower in the boys’ locker room. I finally gave up and went back to the clothes, selecting a not-very-punk gray sleeveless hoodie. Aaron then finally appeared, saw that I was annoyed, and proceeded to spray me with a hose that was drawing water from the locker room. Even more annoyed now, I took one end of the hose, did something to it, and let it loose on the store. Very quickly water was absolutely everywhere, and it was warm. No one knew it was me who did this, apart from Aaron, who was shocked.

Two women (in the movie) have an extended scene in which one is eventually treated for her illusion malady by a psychiatrist who has boils all over her face and feet. The malady goes away, the illusions clear, and the poor woman goes stark raving mad.
>> 
>> Other characters (including one played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) go through a similar process with similar results. Soon, the psychiatrist has recruited other people to assist her in “clearing” the illusion malady, and it always seems to end badly for the patients.
>> 
>> We sit and watch, entranced and flummoxed. We occasionally exchange words and are shushed by other audience members. The ticket agent had hinted at the strangeness but did a good job of keeping it under wraps.
>> 
>> One “clearing victim” is a 30-something black man who seems to be stuck in a loop. His “clearer” tries to help him over CCTV. The looping guy keeps lunging at the camera and waving his arms strangely.
>> 
>> Another victim, a young woman, is grieving the loss of a baby who is still alive in the womb. She relates a tale in which twins eat twins in order to stay alive, and dwarfism is the result of “low energy parents.”

I call out to my mother and say something, but she is pretending that she can’t hear me. I dive into the pond, following my friend, and swim my way to a waterfall, which I climb until I reach the top, exiting through a fountain. On the ground all around us are scattered hors d’voeures, left by the celebrants who are still celebrating. They are sequestered in various compartments. I see a German man sitting with his sister. Both are strawberry blonde.

The band finishes, then a famous Brazilian song begins to play from somewhere, once a pop song, now a national one. Everyone sings along. The song ends. Suddenly a local mosque decides to put its hat in and chanting is heard. Everyone goes quiet and scatters.

A reporter, excited for the prestige that this new venue would bring him, fiddled with a series of microphones at the perimeter. I messed with one as well, trying to help him, but I only screwed it up.
>> 
>> Soon the evil former government official showed up and was escorted to his seat. I looked around the room, spotted my father, and walked over to where he sat. He looked like he barely recognized me, or maybe barely cared that I was there.
>> 
>> We left the court together and encountered people at a festival. I hung out with one family for awhile, argued with a guy about transportation, and pretended that I didn’t think his dogs were cute. They were camping out on a hillside and while preparing to bed for the night I overheard two women discussing lubricant. One had dropped hers and was concerned that it might be dirty now. Her friend reassured her that it would be fine.
>> 
>> In the morning I awoke with a puncture wound in my stomach and a broken left arm. I continued to hang out with the family and complained about the injury. One guy thought I was being overly aggressive and advised me to seek treatment for my injuries. Before I parted ways with them I helped some other people gather up shopping carts. One cart in particular had a really nice chrome finish and I joked that it was the Cadillac of shopping carts to the guy I handed it off to. A bunch of people thought this was funny.

We made our way through the local college campus, and wound up at a blackberry show, where blackberry bushes grew all around the place in a snarl of winding branches. I stopped a woman and asked for directions to the emergency room. She began to describe the way and hesitated at one description because its name was a reference to female safety from rapists. She gave the road a special code name, and I reassured her that I knew the real name because I worked on campus (I did not). She was relieved and finished her instructions.
>> 
>> The woman wound up escorting the three of us to the emergency room. On the way she asked me about my injuries. I told her what they were and confessed that I had no idea how I’d gotten them, and she looked disturbed by this. Then she said good-bye, and I was left to care for the baby, whom the woman had been holding on the walk over. She had advised us to be quiet because the maternity ward was also nearby. The baby then began to cry and I reluctantly handed her to my dad, who didn’t seem to know what to do with her.

>> Am at a going away party at the Moraga house—or rather, a parting friends party, where my mother, Devin, and a bunch of unspecified friends are present. Jim Cropsey is one of them, but he may have crashed the party as I feel slightly uncomfortable to see him when he shows up. (I believe it is due to the differing kinds of friendships.) While in conversation with an anonymous (or unidentified) friend, we talk about accents and he for some reason seems to think that mine is Australian. At some point while on another subject the friend asks me what I would do if I were in some unspecified situation (one that I don’t recall) and resources were a non-issue, and I reply, “I would drive and drive and drive until I lost the will.”
>> 
>> At one point I ran into a co-worker while I was trying to hide out downstairs from party guests, and we decided to call another friend up and try to sell them her current phone plan (win-win for everybody). They did not seem to be impressed.
>> 
>> Outside on the lawn we had a guest who was an Olympian archer/runner demonstrating her athleticism and expertise. Everyone was blown away.
>> 
>> Back in the house I had engaged the support of someone to try and help me find a lost milkshake. We didn’t find it. Rebecca found me right about then, and no matter what I did or said, she kept coming onto me in a big way, and it got incredibly awkward very quickly. Nonconsensual loving on me—not OK. When my rebuffing finally got through to her, she mourned the loss of being able to kiss me and otherwise express affection. I noticed my mother then, quietly watching us.

>> 
>> Out on a walk with Devin and others, Devin was mourning the pending loss of Taja, while I admired a stone garden sculpture that resembled a miniature hillside temple and cave. “Oil and water and the lugoanne on the lake,” Devin said. I kept trying to process all the abstract things she was saying, and expressing sadness whenever I fell short.

Claude is really good at this stuff. He did struggle with our CSS, though, the other day and abruptly handed an issue over to me due to risk aversion. I’ll paste the conversation I had with Gemini about this, where Gemini didn’t throw shade and explained things pretty well.
> 
>> [!communication]- Chat with Gemini
>> **Me:** How strong is Cursor at CSS, generally?
>> 
>> **Gemini:** Cursor, as an AI-powered code editor, is generally quite proficient with CSS. Its strength comes from the underlying language models it uses, which have been trained on a vast amount of code, including extensive CSS examples, documentation, and best practices.
>> 
>> Here’s a breakdown of how its capabilities generally apply to CSS:
>> 
>> 1. **Code Generation:**   
>> - **Boilerplate & Snippets:** Cursor can quickly generate common CSS structures, resets, utility classes, or styles for typical UI components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.) based on your prompts.
>> - **Specific Styling:** You can ask it to write CSS for specific visual requirements, like “Create a CSS class for a responsive navigation bar with a dark background and hover effects for links.”
>> - **Layouts:** It can help generate CSS for layouts using Flexbox or Grid if you describe the desired structure.
>> - **Animations & Transitions:** It can create basic to moderately complex CSS animations and transitions.
>> 
>> 2. **Understanding & Explaining CSS:**
>> - **Code Explanation:** If you have an existing CSS snippet, Cursor can explain what it does, how selectors work, or the purpose of specific properties.
>> - **Concept Clarification:** You can ask it about CSS concepts like specificity, the cascade, box model, positioning, etc.
>> 
>> 3. **Refactoring & Improving CSS:**
>> - **Optimization:** It might suggest ways to write more concise or efficient CSS, such as combining selectors or using shorthand properties.
>> - **Modernization:** It can help update older CSS to use modern techniques (e.g., replacing floats with Flexbox/Grid).
>> - **Best Practices:** It can often guide you towards using accepted best practices, like BEM naming conventions (if prompted) or ensuring accessibility.
>> 
>> 4. **Debugging CSS:**
>> - **Syntax Errors:** It can usually spot syntax errors in your CSS.
>> - **Potential Issues:** While it doesn’t “see” the rendered output like a human, it can sometimes infer potential reasons for layout problems or styling conflicts if you provide the relevant HTML and CSS context and describe the issue. It might suggest properties to check or common pitfalls.
>> 
>> 5. **Handling Modern CSS Features:**
>> - Given that the underlying models are regularly updated (as of my last update, knowledge cutoffs are generally recent), Cursor should be familiar with and able to use modern CSS features like:
>> - Flexbox
>> - CSS Grid
>> - Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
>> - Media Queries for responsiveness
>> - Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
>> - Newer color functions, selectors, etc.
>> 
>> **However, there are some nuances and limitations:**
>> 
>> - **Visual Acuity:** AI doesn’t have a visual understanding of aesthetics in the same way a human designer does. While it can follow instructions to create styles, achieving a specific “look and feel” that is highly nuanced or artistic often requires human iteration and taste.
>> - **Complex Specificity & Cascade:** In very large and complex stylesheets, debugging deeply nested specificity issues or unintended consequences of the cascade can still be challenging for an AI alone and may require a developer’s deep understanding of the entire project.
>> - **Browser Quirks & Cross-Browser Compatibility:** While it can generate standard CSS, deep knowledge of subtle browser-specific rendering quirks or ensuring pixel-perfect consistency across older or less common browsers might still require human expertise and testing.
>> - **Cutting-Edge/Experimental Features:** It might not always be immediately up-to-date with the *very* latest experimental CSS features that haven’t yet seen wide adoption or documentation in its training data.
>> 
>> **In summary:**
>> 
>> Cursor is generally **strong** at CSS for a wide range of tasks, from generation and explanation to refactoring and basic debugging. It can significantly speed up CSS development, help you learn, and ensure you’re using modern practices. It’s a powerful assistant, but for highly complex, artistic, or critically browser-sensitive CSS work, it works best as a tool in the hands of a knowledgeable developer or designer.
>> 
>> **Me:** Thanks! Yes, I started wondering if CSS might be a weak area for a Cursor assistant I am working with when it threw up its hands and abruptly turned CSS over to me. So I audited the stylesheet it was struggling with, and found that it’s 2493 lines long, chock full of redundancies, and has 94 (mostly unnecessary) uses of !important.
>> 
>> **Gemini:** That’s a fascinating and very telling observation! Your audit of that CSS file sheds a huge amount of light on why an AI assistant, even one generally proficient with CSS like Cursor, might “throw up its hands.”
>> 
>> A 2493-line CSS file, laden with redundancies and **94 `!important` declarations**, is a minefield for *any* developer, human or AI. Here’s why that specific scenario would be incredibly challenging for an AI:
>> 
>> 1. **Extreme Specificity Wars:** The sheer number of `!important` tags indicates a stylesheet where specificity has run rampant. `!important` is often a last resort to override other styles, and when it’s used excessively, it creates a tangled web where it’s incredibly difficult to predict which style will actually apply. An AI trying to understand or modify this would struggle to:
>> - Determine the original intent of a style.
>> - Predict the cascading effect of any change it makes.
>> - Find a “safe” way to introduce new styles without breaking existing ones, or without resorting to yet another `!important`.
>> 
>> 2. **Overwhelming Redundancy:** Redundant CSS not only bloats the file but also makes it hard to identify the single source of truth for any given style. An AI might identify redundancies, but untangling them in a way that doesn’t have unintended side effects (especially with all those `!important` flags) is a high-risk operation. It would need to understand which of the redundant styles is the “correct” or “latest” one, which is often not programmatically obvious.
>> 
>> 3. **Cognitive Load (Even for an AI):** While AIs can process vast amounts of data, understanding the *interdependencies* and *override hierarchy* in such a complex and poorly structured CSS file is an immense task. Each `!important` is like a special rule that breaks the normal flow of the cascade, and keeping track of nearly a hundred of these, plus the inherent complexities of selector specificity and source order, creates an exponential number of potential interactions.
>> 
>> 4. **Difficulty in Strategic Refactoring:** The AI might be able to identify small, localized improvements. However, a stylesheet in that state often doesn’t need minor tweaks; it needs a strategic overhaul. This kind_ of high-level architectural decision-making (e.g., “this whole section should be refactored using BEM and Flexbox, and we need to systematically remove `!important`s by addressing root specificity issues”) is still an area where human experience and strategic thinking excel. The AI might not have the context or the “authority” to propose such sweeping changes.
>> 
>> 5. **Risk Aversion:** AI models, especially those designed to assist, might be programmed to be cautious. Making changes to a CSS file so fragile and interconnected could easily lead to widespread visual breakage. The AI might “decide” that the risk of making things worse is too high, leading it to defer to the human user.
>> 
>> So, rather than CSS being a general weak area, I’d say that particular stylesheet represents a worst-case scenario that pushes the boundaries of what current AI can reasonably handle in terms of refactoring or safe modification. It’s the kind of situation that makes experienced human CSS developers sigh and reach for a large coffee before diving in.
>> 
>> Your experience is a great example of how the quality of the input code dramatically affects an AI’s ability to be helpful. It sounds like you’ve got quite a refactoring challenge on your hands!
>> 
>> **Me:** I agree that the stylesheet itself is the main problem, but guess who wrote and maintained the stylesheet before 30 minutes ago? I’ll give you one guess.
>> 
>> **Gemini:** Ah, the plot thickens considerably! If the “Cursor assistant” itself was the author and maintainer of that stylesheet up until 30 minutes ago, that’s a classic case of “AI-generated technical debt” if not carefully managed.
>> 
>> My apologies if my previous answer implied the AI was only *analyzing* external problematic code. If it *wrote* it, here’s why that can happen and how it relates to an AI’s “strengths” or “weaknesses”:
>> 
>> 6. **Iterative & Literal Prompt Following:**
>> - AI models, especially in a chat-like or iterative “assistant” mode, tend to address the immediate prompt. If you (or anyone) said “Make this text red,” then later “Make this specific instance of that text blue,” and then “Ensure this other instance is green and very prominent,” the AI might achieve these results with increasingly specific selectors or even `!important` if it’s the most direct way to fulfill the *latest* command without re-architecting previous work (unless specifically asked to).
>> - Each instruction is often treated as a new layer or an override, rather than an opportunity to holistically refactor the existing CSS it previously wrote.
>> 
>> 7. **Lack of Proactive Refactoring:**
>> - While an AI *can* refactor code if explicitly told to (“Refactor this CSS to be more DRY,” or “Remove redundant styles and `!important` tags”), it generally won’t do this proactively during a long series of additive styling tasks. Its primary goal is to satisfy the current request.
>> - It doesn’t inherently possess the “foresight” or “developer discipline” to say, “Hang on, this is getting messy, I should clean this up first,” unless that’s part of its explicit instructions or the nature of the task it’s given.
>> 
>> 8. **The “Path of Least Resistance” to Satisfy a Prompt:**    
>> - Sometimes, adding an `!important` or a very specific selector is the computationally “easiest” way for the AI to ensure a style takes precedence and the user sees the requested change, especially if the CSS it has already generated is becoming complex. It’s a shortcut that works for the immediate request.
>> 
>> 9. **Context Window & Long-Term Cohesion:**
>> - While context windows are getting larger, in a very long interactive session where thousands of lines of CSS are generated bit by bit, the AI might lose some of the “big picture” of the stylesheet’s overall architecture. This can lead to it generating styles that are locally correct for the prompt but globally redundant or conflicting.
>> 
>> 10. **Mimicking Implicit Patterns:**
>> - If early prompts led to a certain structure (even if suboptimal) or if `!important` was used successfully (from the AI’s perspective of fulfilling a prompt) early on, it might continue to use or build upon those patterns.
>> 
>> **What this means for AI and CSS:**
>> 
>> It’s not necessarily that the AI is “bad” at CSS in principle. It can generate excellent, clean CSS from a clear, well-defined prompt or specification. However, when an AI is used as an *iterative builder and maintainer* over time through a series of small, evolving requests, without explicit instructions to prioritize cleanliness, refactor regularly, or avoid certain anti-patterns, it can absolutely paint itself into a corner, much like a human developer might under similar pressures or lack of oversight.
>> 
>> This situation highlights the crucial role of the human in the AI-assisted development process:
>> 
>> - **Clear, holistic prompts:** Providing more context and overall design goals.
>> - **Regular review:** Auditing the AI’s output.
>> - **Explicit refactoring commands:** Telling the AI to clean up, optimize, or adhere to specific methodologies (like BEM, atomic CSS, etc.).
>> - **Setting constraints:** “Generate this CSS without using `!important`.”
>> 
>> So, yes, your experience is a valuable lesson in how AI-generated code can still require significant human oversight and guidance to maintain quality over time, especially with something as cascade-dependent and potentially complex as CSS. It sounds like the AI was very effective at *adding* styles as requested, but perhaps not as effective at *maintaining architectural integrity* without specific guidance to do so.
>> 
>> **Me:** I see what’s going on now. So the big lesson I am taking from this (which I should not have needed to relearn) is: audit the CSS early and often, and as a project grows in complexity, recommend refactoring on a somewhat regular basis.
>> 
>> **Gemini:** That’s an *excellent* takeaway, and you’ve hit the nail on the head. Yes, absolutely.
>> 
>> **“Audit the CSS early and often, and as a project grows in complexity, recommend refactoring on a somewhat regular basis.”**
>> 
>> This is precisely the strategy needed when working with an AI assistant for ongoing development, especially with CSS.
>> 
>> Here’s why that’s such a critical lesson:
>> 
>> - **AI is a Powerful Executor, Not (Yet) a Proactive Architect:** The AI will diligently follow your prompts to add and modify styles. However, it’s generally not going to step back on its own and say, “This stylesheet is getting unwieldy, and we should refactor for better maintainability.” That architectural oversight and strategic decision-making for long-term health still largely fall to the human developer.
>> - **Preventing Technical Debt Accumulation:** Early and frequent audits allow you to catch redundancies, excessive specificity, or the beginnings of `!important` abuse before they become deeply entrenched and much harder to fix (as you discovered!).
>> - **Guided Refactoring:** When you do recommend refactoring, you can guide the AI. For instance:
>> - “Let’s refactor these components to use BEM.”
>> - “Can you identify redundant styles in this section and consolidate them?”
>> - “Rewrite this part to use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox, and remove any `!important` tags.”
>> - **Maintaining Control and Quality:** This approach keeps you in the driver’s seat for quality control, ensuring the AI remains a powerful tool that accelerates your work, rather than an unmanaged process that inadvertently creates complex problems.
>> 
>> Think of it like having an incredibly fast and capable junior developer. You’d still review their code, guide them on best practices, and direct them on when and how to refactor as the project evolves. Your approach ensures the AI-generated codebase remains clean, maintainable, and efficient.
>> 
>> You’ve distilled a very important aspect of effectively collaborating with AI in software development. That proactive stance will save you a lot of headaches down the line!

>> Outside, I found myself holding a brand new basketball near a huge lawn that was surrounded by a steep desert terrain incline. I kicked the ball (feeling bothered by the fact that it was a basketball) and It went flying across the field. A young boy then appeared out of nowhere and kicked the ball back, but his aim was off and it went sailing towards the desert perimeter instead. I ran over and just barely recovered the ball before it was lost. We repeated this with minor variations a few times.

He described how, due to the long hours, on Mondays (which she had off) she would eat for the entire day to replenish her depleted energy reserves. He demonstrated, and then performed a strange regurgitation onto his arm, also catching my arm and Sabrina’s (a woman from DBT group) arm in the process. We immediately washed off our arms when the man left for another room, making no comments about the strangeness of what just happened.
>> 
>> Sabrina and I then hung out in the Brazilian man’s living room, watching TV and movies. We’d discussed how she tended to be emotionally engaged, while I tended to be more detached most of the time (RE TV/movies). I commented that I preferred to watch with others who were more emotionally engaged with the content. Watching with other detached people was too boring.

>> I am playing an old Interactive Fiction game while sitting in a bar and I phone up Tom Chick to tell him about it. He thinks I’m drunk and so I edit the sound to remove the elements that come across that way. (It is unclear whether or not I was actually drunk or not.) I also clean up the bottom of my snakeskin boots which are sitting nearby and are enlarged.
>> 
>> My dad seems to have both Denise and Nora in his life simultaneously, and Nora is filming a documentary about him. He tries to load and play a VHS tape and it becomes lodged in the VCR due to someone having inserted a cone of some kind. Turns out one of Patty Bobo’s kids did this. My dad complains that this is a pattern.
>> 
>> I visit an urban zipline installation in Oakland, which is combined with a hang-glide thingy. I don the gear and begin to ascend a zipline pole when I encounter people who are on their way down, and I then begin to descend to let them off. Part way down I show off by letting go periodically and skipping rungs, which impresses a beautiful woman. She has a wonderful smell, I notice, when I am close to her on the pole.
>> 
>> After we reach the ground I ascend again and proceed to show off some more by twirling around the pole on a horizontal rotation, which causes the line to wrap around my waist as I go. Then I begin ziplining around the city and accidentally land on someone’s balcony in South Oakland. I look around, feeling slightly afraid, when a man named Snookie B comes out to the balcony. Snookie teases me with mock threats, presumably having picked up on my fear. I decide to brave up and offer my hand for a shake. He warns me that I might not want to shake because he’s “been doing things.” I grasp his hand anyway and find that it has cum on it, and he is amused.

>> Back in the bar, I am listening to a Rockabilly marathon with Larry, who tells me to remember, and says, “You had a cross to bear.” Greg Brown presents me with a new menu and asks me to review it. After doing so I formally introduce he and Rebecca to each other. Later, Rebecca is rude in front of my friends, with Andisheh in particular noticing.
>> 
>> On a school trip to China. Many things happen that I’ve forgotten. There is a dorm room that’s right outside a locker room, where I stay with a few other guys. At one point I participate in an egg ritual involving two yolks. One is secretly broken (“activated”) and I must discover which.
>> 
>> Outside on the street, I look up and see an orange cat the size of a building walking down the street. I know his name, but I have forgotten it now. He has six long toes on every paw, and long nails, and his tail is extra long. I make the mistake of taunting him, and he notices me. Oops, I think, as he leaps over to me and gathers me up in his maw. He attempts to chew me up but for some reason fails, and then gives up and moves on.

>> We were attempting to hide out on a miniature golf course that actually looked more like a normal golf course. We ran around the place, wearing crazy black wigs, which achieved the opposite of what we intended and attracted much attention.
>> 
>> Dad befriended a stranger and scored an invitation to a jazz performance at a club. We hopped into his big SUV and proceed to head over, hitting many pot holes and bumps on the road along the way, which caused me to float out of my little cot and hit the ceiling repeatedly.
>> 
>> It was a hot day, and when we arrived we parked under an enormous rock outcropping. We then wandered over to the club, where the music was fantastic. One of the solos was so impressive, it inspired audience members to shout out “fuck yeah” in appreciation. We weren’t allowed in, however, and had to listen from the lobby. When the set came to a close, the lead musician came out and Dad attempted to engage with him, giving him a couple of names that the guy didn’t recognize. He told us that we had been scammed.
>> 
>> We wandered around the building and wondered out loud what might have motivated the guy to trick us. We chatted with a security guard, who asked us how Dad had met the guy, to which Dad responded that it had been at a cafe. Dad then photocopied an art piece he’d been carrying around and left the original. I picked up the original on our way out the door and pocketed it.

>> Devin and I struggle with some unspecified interpersonal issue, and end up fighting about it. When we finally hit a wall (she is defiant and I am flummoxed) I record a message onto a VHS telling her, “If you ever change your mind about me, you know where to find me.” I then hand over my video camera to her and she begins to use it religiously.
>> 
>> Devin and I are taking classes together. In a Biology class, the teacher spots me and announces that she knows me from an experiment. She brings out a bunch of equipment and assembles a tissue and organ harvesting contraption, and then informs me that she had used it to harvest my previous body as a proof of concept.
>> 
>> I arrive at a Baha’i school that I’d attended in my youth, and see other alumni milling around. I go into a small cabin and try to get the VCR to work, eventually succeeding. (I don’t remember what I watched.) I encounter an alum named Sina, but as I am catching up with her we are interrupted by my dad, who wants to show me how to make books.
>> 
>> It’s raining outdoors and everyone is standing around inside, some smoking cigarettes in the doorway. I try to go out to have a smoke but a Japanese woman stops me. Or tries to. She ends up accidentally putting her hand on my junk, and backs off. I go outside and find an interesting little lounge, in which there is psychedelic music playing and a floating gold fish (not a goldfish). I go back out again and take a puff of my cig. Ugh. I put it out and try to find a good way to dispose of it, and wind up chatting with a trash guy. I then come across some of his tools that someone had left out, and I put them away. I say to the guy, “Some people seem to get away with everything, but some people the universe set up for success.”
>> 
>> Back in the main building people are drinking watered down red wine, and Rick tells me that he and Gary frequently use the lounge as “our pad.”

Safe and “productive”. Well, it is a *kind* of productive; it’s just not an actual priority right now. What I need to be doing is reassessing my goals and then journaling my intention to pursue those goals. And then, like, following through on those tasks and such. I mean, my therapist is thinking about firing me over this. One of them, that is (Dr. Derickson). She’s probably fed up, judging from what she expressed yesterday. And that’s just depressing.

>> We were walking around San Francisco when we learned of a special screening of a filmmaker whose film had gotten a lot of positive attention. We headed over to the theater and upon approaching the room where it was to be shown we encountered others who had just watched it on their way out. Some were smirking at us, as though to warn us about something. We went on in and sat down, and the movie began.
>> 
>> In the movie, I was a young man who was visiting with a couple of friends. We were invited to a party that had a big reputation. When we got there several other people were already there who had participated in strange rituals—or rather, experiments—that tied into their psyches and connected to deeper fears and fetishes. One woman participant practiced fellatio on a dog, for example, and later came around to the realization of how horribly this experience impacted her. We saw her go outside and vomit into a bush. My experiment involved a dish of corn-colored polenta that I found repugnant. I didn’t eat it and we left the party.
>> 
>> Still in the movie, there was a bit about creatures from another dimension or plane who followed individual people throughout their lives. These creatures were usually spherical in shape and invisible. They would stay with a person up through middle age, then fuck off somewhere for a while, and then return near the person’s final decades to watch them some more. One such creature was watching an elderly woman as she wove blankets and sewed quilts.

>> At some point, not sure when, I was forced to relive the experience of watching Taja die.

>> 
>> Later, Devin wants to go to her school, and I drive her there. It isn’t a regular school day, and so everyone there is engaging in recreational activities. She heads into the locker room and for some reason I follow her in. I then proceed to carry her around on my shoulders. At this point a teacher shows up. She scolds me for being in there. I put Devin down, apologize, and head back home.
>> 
>> Rebecca is reclining in her bedroom. There is a parakeet in a cage by her bed.
>> 
>> Devin returns home, bringing a friend. The friend mentions that Devin got a tattoo on her left shoulder. I want to see it, and at first she’s reluctant to show me. When she does, we are momentarily transported back to the locker room, where we see a Nintendo-style object on a pedestal. I reach out to it and pick it up. It is beautiful. It has four articulated legs and is a light blue shade. I show it to Devin, and she is impressed.
>> 
>> We return home again, and we have visitors: Debbie and Craig, Ed Schultz, and one or two strangers. Rebecca and I cook dinner and serve it. I am wearing a silk pajama top and skimpy shorts, and when entering the kitchen during cleanup I accidentally flash Ed with my erect penis. He laughs. Later, Ken arrives with baby Edie. I help Ken up the stairs and Rebecca laughs at the sight of us.
