## Recent Improvements

- All inline styles for UI elements (autocomplete dropdowns, suggestion lists, expand/collapse dream content, etc.) have been moved to the main stylesheet (`styles.css`).
- Dynamic positioning and sizing for dropdowns now use CSS variables, improving maintainability and theme compatibility.
- The expand/collapse UI for dream content is now fully accessible, keyboard-friendly, and visually polished.
- Metrics now support custom icons via a user-friendly icon picker in the Metric Editor Modal.
- Dream content extraction now strips `[!dream-metrics]` callouts and their content, ensuring clean previews and exports.

## Planned Improvements

- Add search/filter functionality to the metric icon picker.
- Add more icons to the icon picker for greater variety.
